Entrepreneurs don't spend many calories thinking about or working on culture. &nbsp;There are several common reasons for this:</p>\n<p>a) Culture? &nbsp;We don't need no stinkin' culture! &nbsp;We're putting a dent in the universe. &nbsp;That's our f*!#ing culture!</p>\n<p>b) Culture? &nbsp;Relax. &nbsp;We got this one covered. &nbsp;We have free beer and a ping poing table.</p>\n<p>c) Culture? &nbsp;You can't really create that. &nbsp;It has to be built organically. It just comes from the behaviors and example of the founders.</p>\n<p>All of those are reasonable positions to take. &nbsp;They're misguided, but they're reasonable.</p>\n<p>a) Most of the startups that did end up putting a dent in the universe didn't really know that they were going to succeed at it. &nbsp;And, one of the few common characteristics of super-successful companies is that they have a distinct culture. &nbsp;Google. &nbsp;Facebook. Zapps. Netflix. &nbsp;The list goes on and one. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>b) Maybe you can't create a culture -- but you can certainly destroy it through neglect. &nbsp;The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics applies here. &nbsp;Left alone, most things degrade to crap. &nbsp;In the early days, it's OK to rely on the behavior of the founders and early team to set the culture. &nbsp;That works great. &nbsp;The problem with this model is that as you start to grow, there's a fair amount lost in translation.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Convention over Configuration</strong>. &nbsp;Yes, you could just let people make decisions organically based on their best interpretation of whatever they think the right model/framework is. &nbsp;But, I generally favor convention over configuration. &nbsp;Why not just have a convention (i.e. culture) that makes a large body of easy decisions and a small body of hard decisions easier? &nbsp;The result is more efficient and more consistent decision-making. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">4. <strong>product:marketing :: culture : recruiting</strong></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">product is to marketing as culture is to recruiting. &nbsp;Yes, you might be able to do amazing marketing -- but it's not going to matter if the product isn't amazing. &nbsp;It's a tough slog. &nbsp;Similarly, if you're looking to recruit amazing people (who isn't), you're going to need to a great culture. &nbsp;The kind of culture that will appeal to the right kinds of people and get them to self-select.</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">5. <strong>The interest on culture debt is really high.</strong></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">You've heard about technology debt. &nbsp;That's when you take short-cuts today, because you *need* to get something out the door. &nbsp;You willingly take these short-cuts, because time is suer-valuable (just like cash is valuable when you take on financial debt). &nbsp;But, you understand that there will be a time to pay off that debt. &nbsp;And, the debt carries an interest rate. &nbsp;Culture debt is when you take a short-cut -- hire someone now because they have the skills you need and you're *hurting* for people -- but they're not a good culture fit. &nbsp;You let the \"culture bar\" down. &nbsp;You might do this for logical reasons. &nbsp;For the same reason you might incur technology debt or financial debt. &nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">I'm going to posit that the effective interest rate on the culture debt you take on is often higher than that of technology debt. &nbsp;That is, when it comes time to pay off the debt -- a lot of damage is done. &nbsp;There are a couple of reasons for this: &nbsp;1) When you incur technology debt (like not adding sharding to your database), you generally will start feeling pain at some point, and you'll then decide to pay off that debt. &nbsp;It's a *known* problem and when you solve it, you'll sort of know you did. That's not the case with cultural debt. &nbsp;Culture debt is insidious. &nbsp;It creeps in slowly. &nbsp;It's hard to measure. &nbsp;2) Technology debt is often \"forgiven\". &nbsp;This happens when a short-cut you took ends up not being a bad thing anyways. &nbsp;An example might be that you hacked together an MVF (minimum viable feature) for something in the app. &nbsp;The code is crap. &nbsp;You're not proud of it. &nbsp;Then later, you decide to abandon that particular feature. &nbsp;Guess what, your tech debt on that feature was just forgiven. &nbsp;That almost never happens in cultural debt. &nbsp;If you bring on people that aren't a fit, they'll <em>infect</em>&nbsp;other parts of the organization, and will be really hard to get back to where you want to be.</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">6. <strong>Create the culture you want, not the one you think you <em>should</em>&nbsp;have.</strong></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">There's a lot of content out there regarding \"winning\" startup cultures. &nbsp;Some will advocate for an open/transparent culture. &nbsp;Some for a design-focused culture. &nbsp;Some for a service and customer-centric culture. &nbsp;Fact is, any of these will likely work. &nbsp;The key is to understand what it is that defines your culture (and importantly, what makes it <em>differetn</em>&nbsp;from other companies) -- and to build alignment around that culture. &nbsp;And, in order for the culture to survive long-term, you need to <em>love</em>&nbsp;it. &nbsp;You need to believe in it. &nbsp;If you simply try to tweak the culture based on what you think the right answer is, you'll lose steam and lose conviction. &nbsp;Game over.</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"></div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><b>Summary: &nbsp;</b>You <em>can</em>&nbsp;nudge your culture. &nbsp;It's worth it. &nbsp;You're going to have a culture anyways -- might as well build one you want. &nbsp;</div><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/96107/Culture-Code-Creating-A-Company-YOU-Love.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=bi0iWy6DQGU:8Ogmz5Iz0_M:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/bi0iWy6DQGU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/bi0iWy6DQGU/Culture-Code-Creating-A-Company-YOU-Love.aspx", :published_at => Sat, 09 Mar 2013 22:23:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:96107", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

What makes my approach unconventional is that I have a few “rules”:</p>\n<p>All of the rules are based on one simple constraint:&nbsp; I have no time.&nbsp; I have no time to spend on/with startups because I'm maniacally committed and focused on my own company&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://hubspot.com/\">HubSpot</a>), which is doing very well.&nbsp; That's where all available time goes.&nbsp; If I didn't have these rules in place, I wouldn't be able to angel invest at all.</p>\n<p>So here are my rules:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>No due diligence</strong>.&nbsp; Seriously, almost none.&nbsp; In over half the deals I've done, I've never met the entrepreneurs or talked to them on the phone.&nbsp; Generally just exchanged an email or two.&nbsp; My rationale here is two-fold:&nbsp; I'm optimizing for my time (my biggest constraint) not magnitude of outcome.&nbsp; Also, I think at the very early stages, most diligence that typical investors spend time on is “undue”.&nbsp; There's just not that much that's knowable.&nbsp; Either you like the people, or you don't.&nbsp; You like the idea, or you don't (which is irrelevant, because the idea's likely going to change anyways).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. <strong>No follow-on investments</strong>.&nbsp; This one's controversial.&nbsp; Many&nbsp;would argue that it's economically stupid for me not to “double down” on the deals that I have&nbsp;a right to maintain my pro-rata investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;They might be right (but I don't think they are).&nbsp; The reason I don't do&nbsp;follow-ons is that it requires&nbsp;spending time (which I don't have) and for the deals that I don't invest in, I&nbsp;might create a signaling problem for the entrepreneur.&nbsp;&nbsp;By unilaterally not doing any follow-on investments, all signaling issues go away.&nbsp; This&nbsp;has worked brilliantly for me so far.&nbsp; I take the money that I would have invested in deals I'm already in, and just channel it to new startups.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grand scheme of things, I think this works out well for everyone.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>No advisory&nbsp;board positions or official involvement. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, this goes back to the lack of time.&nbsp; I don't have time to commit, so I don't commit it.&nbsp; Occasionally, I'll make an&nbsp;email introduction, or see&nbsp;entrepreneurs in my portfolio for a nice dinner — but other than that, they almost never see me or hear from me.</p>\n<p>Overall, my unconventional approach seems to be working OK.&nbsp; I'd put my angel investment portfolio up against any early-stage investor (angel or VC).&nbsp; After all is done, I'm going to make a fair amount of money. &nbsp;<em>If you don't think so, just <a href=\"http://dharme.sh/zNYbVF\" title=\"check out my portfolio\" target=\"_self\">check out my portfolio</a>.</em></p>\n<p>And, to those that might criticize my unconventional approach and classify me as \"part of the problem\" (the problem being, the \"Series A Crunch\"), I have a simple response/position: &nbsp;<strong>There's no such thing as too many companies starting up. &nbsp;But, there is such a thing as not enough companies shutting down.</strong>..but that's a different problem. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Important Note: &nbsp;If you are seeking angel investment, just about <em>all</em>&nbsp;of my investments these days are through AngelList (Disclosure: I'm not just a member of AngelList, I'm also an investor). &nbsp;And, I focus exclusively on Internet/software companies. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br><a href=\"http://dharme.sh/YP8Wdk\" target=\"_self\"><img id=\"img-1360012156173\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/launch-festival.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"launch festival\" class=\"alignCenter\"></a></p>\n<p>So, back to my crazy $25,000 investment.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I heard about the upcoming <a href=\"http://dharme.sh/YP8Wdk\">LAUNCH Festival </a>hosted by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jason\">Jason Calacanis</a>.&nbsp; Jason sent an email out announcing that as part of LAUNCH, he was putting together the <a href=\"http://launchhackathon.com/\" title=\"best hackathon in history\" target=\"_self\">best hackathon in history</a>.&nbsp; Jason was going to angel&nbsp;invest $25,000 into the winning team.&nbsp; When I saw that email, I thouht “that's a pretty good idea, and I've done stupider things”.&nbsp; So, I volunteered to match Jason's $25k with $25k of my own.

Throughout the entire hiring process, we’re constantly looking for signs of the four most important startup personalities: The Beast, Lara Croft, The Architect, and The Most Interesting Man in the World.<img id=\"img-1359739794085\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/xmen-small.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"xmen small\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>Our initial process is probably quite similar to many other startups.

Next, candidates go through a phone screen to determine basic experience and qualifications. Those that survive the phone call visit with multiple team members on-site, where they’re assessed on skill and personality.</p>\n<p>However, the final step is a little different. Before securing a job at Boundless everyone gives a 20 minute presentation on your personal or professional passion. We like to give the entire team a chance to see the candidate, and give the candidate an opportunity to impress the team with anything they want. We’ve seen people present on Tai Chi, cupcakes, coffee, how to build an art collection on a budget - all kinds of interesting, quirky and funny topics. And, of course, by this point in the process we have a strong idea of the type of a person the candidate is.</p>\n<p><b>The Four Critical Startup Personality Types</b></p>\n<p>The Beast, Lara Croft, The Architect, and The Most Interesting Man in the World. When filling a role at your startup, you need to find a candidate that embodies characteristics from each of these personalities if you are going to create a culture that changes the world. I firmly believe that a large part of my company’s success is driven by employees with characteristics strongly matching these personalities.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to identify these four startup personalities:</p>\n<p><b>The Beast</b></p>\n<p>The startup <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_(comics)\">Beast</a>, modeled after the X-men character, possesses a “get shit done” mentality. A Beast’s raw animal output ensures they get more done in a day than even the most caffeinated worker bee. These people strive to be the very best in their profession, and doing more than seems humanly possible helps them get there. Look for people with high levels of productivity at their last positions and ridiculous amounts of drive and energy.</p>\n<p><b>Lara Croft</b></p>\n<p>When hiring, look for adventurers with an entrepreneurial spirit. These <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Croft\">Lara Croft </a>types create goals and projects for themselves to enhance the company values or goals. People who are self starters, self motivated, who have built things on their own time to scratch their own itch are Croft. Their adventurous minds dream big to help inspire the team.</p>\n<p><b>The Architect</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect_(The_Matrix)\">The Architect</a>, inspired by the character from The Matrix, understands the big picture and can still focus on the details. These are the people who have a productivity hack for nearly all aspects of their life. Being productive and organized with the details helps The Architect keep the big picture in mind. You can spot Architects as people who have taken pride in a craft or know the intricate details of their previous position plus can clearly articulate the high-level strategy.</p>\n<p><b>The Most Interesting Man in the World</b></p>\n<p>At any fast-growing startup, you’ll spend a lot of time collaborating and hanging out with your colleagues. To make your office lunches or happy hours more enjoyable for all involved, hire people with character and charm for your team. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Interesting_Man_in_the_World\">The Most Interesting Man in the World</a>, seen in the Dos Equis commercials, adds depth to your company culture. And in tough times, the Interesting Man (or woman) is the person you want fighting on your team and who help keep you going during the tough time. Don’t just look for goofballs - find people who have overcome difficult challenges and kept a positive attitude.</p>\n<p>By hiring based on these four personalities, Boundless has built a team that not only has the capacity to build the best learning platform possible, but a team that continues to attract other top-notch people to share the journey with us.</p>\n<p>We recently had the pleasure of welcoming <a href=\"https://twitter.com/healyhoops\">Healy Jones</a> to Boundless as our new Vice President of Marketing. The Beast in Healy helped our open <a href=\"https://www.boundless.com/textbooks/\">textbooks</a> initiative get written up in <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/22/free-open-source-digital-textbook-provider-boundless-releases-its-content-under-creative-commons/\">TechCrunch</a>, and his wine tasting team presentation won him a nod in the Most Interesting Man in the World category. He joins Boundless from <a href=\"http://www.officedrop.com/\">OfficeDrop</a> where he was VP of Marketing, where he helped grow the user base 120 times in two years.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re hiring a new team member as a VP or entry-level, remember that killer personalities help make the journey from idea to strong startup possible.</p>\n<p><em>This is a guest post from Ariel Diaz.

Be a hero. &nbsp;Go after that big, powerful incumbent that doesn't delight its customers enough.</span></p>\n<p>2.

Be a hero. &nbsp;Make that sacrifice that will negatively impact your profits but completely aligns with your passions.</p>\n<p>4. Be a hero. &nbsp;Make that really, really hard decision that even the smartest people you know can't seem to agree on.</p>\n<p>5. Be a hero. &nbsp;Say no to that accomplished, super-successful person that your team interviewed, loved and convinced to join -- but doesn't fit your culture.</p>\n<p>6. Be a hero. &nbsp;Kill that stupid company policy that nobody can recall the rationale for, but you suspect was because someone (maybe you) had a friend who knew a guy that had read about a startup that didn't have that policy and that company failed.</p>\n<p>7. Be a hero. &nbsp;Launch that super-secret project you've been working on even though it's more likely to fail than succeed.</p>\n<p>8. Be a hero. &nbsp;Admit that you've changed your mind on the decision you so passionately advocated for a few months ago</p>\n<p>9. Be a hero. &nbsp;Confess to your team that sometimes you take the safer path out of fear and rationalize that you're doing it for the good of the company.</p><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/93733/Entrepreneurs-DO-Be-A-Hero.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ihhdHFgBqeI:292PzpEsg34:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/ihhdHFgBqeI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/ihhdHFgBqeI/Entrepreneurs-DO-Be-A-Hero.aspx", :published_at => Thu, 03 Jan 2013 04:55:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:93733", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

Will adding this feature cause more people to start paying for the product?</p>\n<p>2. If we increase our prices, will our overall revenue increase or decrease?</p>\n<p>3. If we make this feature that was previously free part of our premium offering, will users be upset?</p>\n<p>Experiments are great -- but one word of warning. &nbsp;Be mindful of how much data you need and how \"clean\" your experiment needs to be in order to yield the learning you are seeking. &nbsp;A mistake we often make is looking at the \"early evidence\" from a particular experiment -- and then, in the interests of time and/or money (both of which are in short supply), use that early evidence to make an \"educated guess\" and move on.<img id=\"img-1357068207761\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/evidence-cartoon.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"evidence cartoon\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>This \"educated guess\" based on some early evidence is often \"good enough\". &nbsp;There are lots of questions for which you don't need perfect answers. &nbsp;All you need is something reasonably better than random -- or something that validates a strong \"instinct\" you already had.</p>\n<p>But, be careful. &nbsp;The rigor of your experiment should match the importance of the issue at hand. &nbsp;If it's a big, important decision that will shape your company for a long time, don't just rely on the \"early evidence\" and use it to rationalize whatever it is that you wanted to do in the first place. &nbsp;Take the time to let the experiment run its course. &nbsp;For big, important, critical issues -- the extra rigor is worth it.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: &nbsp;You want to know whether taking a particular feature *out* of your product is going to have a major impact on your users. &nbsp;The feature didn't work out as well as you had hoped, and it ended up being very expensive to maintain. &nbsp;So, you send a survey out to your 5,000 users. &nbsp;Of the first 500 responses that come back, 80% of the people ranked the feature as \"Super-duper important, if you take it out, I'll use another product\". &nbsp;So, you could just take this early evidence, extrapolate and say -- \"Hey, if 80% of our users really want this feature, we should just keep it in.\" &nbsp;In reality, what <em>might</em>&nbsp;be happening here is that the users that were most passionate about the feature, and thought that you might cut it are the ones that <em>first</em>&nbsp;responded to the survey. &nbsp;Users that were kind of \"meh\" (or didn't even know the feature was there) might take a while to respond, if it all. &nbsp;Basically, the early responses are not representative of your overall user-base. &nbsp;If you let more of the evidence come in, you might find that the <em>actual</em>&nbsp;number of users that care is much smaller than the \"early evidence\" showed.</p>\n<h2><b>The Danger of the Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</b></h2>\n<p><strong></strong>Another thing to be careful of when it comes to \"early evidence\". &nbsp;If this early evidence leaks into the organization, you often will trigger a self-fulfilling prophecy and wind up with a potentially misguided decision. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Example: &nbsp;</strong>You ask your sales team to start selling a new offer (could be a feature/product/promotion). &nbsp;Understandably, the first few attempts don't work out very well -- the sales team hasn't quite figured out yet how to position the offering. &nbsp;It will likely take a few weeks. &nbsp;In the meantime, word starts to spread that this \"new thing\" isn't selling all that well. &nbsp;As a result, the team pulls back a bit and reverts to selling the \"old thing\" (change is hard). &nbsp;This of course, causes even fewer sales of the new thing -- and it ultimately gets abandoned. &nbsp;Now, that might have been the right decision. &nbsp;Perhaps the early evidence was right -- but you don't know for sure. &nbsp;What if just a couple of weeks of training and tweaking would have fixed the issue. &nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;it would have been <em>awesome</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p>In summary: &nbsp;Don't confuse early evidence with compelling evidence. &nbsp;Avoid letting early results of an experiment taint the rest of the experiment. &nbsp;And, match the rigor of your experiment to the importance of the decision on hand.</p>\n<p>Any examples you can think of when early evidence is misleading?

But, can you just copy the best practices from these amazing companies and use them to succeed at your own business? I doubt it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is risk of pulling out the wrong lessons from these outliers. To be exceptional, they have to be the exception -- not the rule. Often, what worked brilliantly for them might be a blunder for you.<img id=\"img-1356544819045\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/woman-question.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"woman question\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>If you or one of your colleagues ever make arguments that sound similar to these, take a step back and question your assumptions:</p>\n<p>\"This worked for Apple and Steve Jobs...\"</p>\n<p>\"But, Google does it this way, and they've done really well...\"</p>\n<p>\"That didn't seem to stop Amazon...\"</p>\n<p>Here are the types of mistakes we make when looking to learn from leaders:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Then vs. Now</strong></p>\n<p>When you are looking to learn from great companies, be mindful that you undestand the history of the strategy or tactic you are looking to learn from.</p>\n<p>Example: Google makes deep investments in technology and infrastructure. Rather than taking \"off the shelf\" tools and technologies, Google uses custom-built servers and operating systems. Though this makes great sense for Google, given their scale -- does that level of customization make sense for your startup? What did Google do when they were your size?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Loss Leaders are a Luxury</strong></p>\n<p>Big, well capitalized companies can often make big bets and investments that most startups simply can't afford. They can often use these \"loss leader\" strategies because they have a diversified revenue base and can gain an advantage by losing money in one project with the hopes of making it up in another -- often after many years.</p>\n<p>Example: When Amazon sells the Kindle, it intentionally does it at razor thin margins (the actual razor, not the blade). The reason Jeff Bezos provides for this strategy is simple: \"We want to make money when people use our device...not when they buy it.\" That works great for Amazon, because in the long run, they will make money. But, unless you're Amazon and can afford to give something away at low or no margin, it might not be the right strategy for you.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Great companies don't&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;make great decisions</strong></p>\n<p>When we look at successful companies, we automatically assume that every strategy or tactic they used contributed to that success. That's unlikely. Sometimes companies are successful&nbsp;<em>despite</em>&nbsp;some missteps along the way -- not because of them. If you're making a big decision based on whether or not it worked for someone else, dig into the details. Try and figure out the context of that particular strategy. Talk to the people involved. Did they think it was a great strategy? What were the tradeoffs? What surprised them? If they could do it over again, would they?</p>\n<p>Example: When Apple decides for a more closed and proprietary system, do they win in the long-term because of those decisions -- or despite them, because they are so good at everything else? Could other companies succeed with a similar strategy?</p>\n<p>It is a weak argument to say you should be doing [x] just because some super-successful company did [x] and it worked for them. They were a different company at a different time -- and in many cases, even the teams that made some of those decisions are likely not certain as to whether they were the right ones.</p>\n<p>When you're faced with big, company-changing decisions don't use outliers as a way to rationalize what you want to do. Dig deeper. Do some additional research. Analyze the tradeoffs and make the right decision given your context.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?

This is the story of how our reality turned into something of the opposite effect.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Familiar Doubt</strong></h2>\n<p>Many friends, fellow founders and business professionals told us along the way that creating a B2B interactive business platform would be a difficult project. (Hey, we knew that.)</p>\n<p>People later told us that the most difficult aspect would be market entry. (Again, no surprise there.) The consensus among those critical of our venture was consistent, and usually along the lines of, “Don’t you want to do something more glamorous than a B2B platform? Maybe something B2C?”<img src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/stink1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"describe the image\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>(Actually, we believe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.exploreb2b.com\">our concept</a>&nbsp;is glamorous and quite frankly, exactly what we believe the B2B market calls for.)</p>\n<p>Any way you thought about it, the task at hand was going to be tough. The start was the most challenging, with an idea and an empty platform. But we were not the first facing this issue; surely there would be ways to maneuver our way into our key markets?</p>\n<p>We knew some companies who successfully bought profiles or created fake ones, but decided that if we really believed in our concept, we would need real people behind genuine profiles and articles. And that we would need press coverage.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did we solve the first problem of filling the platform?</strong></h2>\n<p>We first talked face-to-face with various professionals we knew to get them interested and excited enough to participate on the platform, even though the it was new. It was hard, but we did it. Twice. Once on the German site, and again, when we went international with the English platform.</p>\n<p>We were ready to move onto the next stage.</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;<strong>Growth.</strong></h2>\n<p>How do you go about growing something like a self-publishing platform for B2B professionals? How do you create public awareness? Would press coverage do the trick? High-profile technology publications, with all of their reach, would be a nice start…wouldn’t they?</p>\n<p>Indeed, we tried various forms of press outreach. After making a bad choice with a PR company for the German market, we chose the PR Company for our international venture with care. After months of consideration, research and negotiation, we made a deal with high hopes that we would see the benefits of this lucrative investment. While it would be wrong to say we gained&nbsp;<em>nothing&nbsp;</em>from this several month contract, it would be an exaggeration to say that it was worth the time, energy and money to do it again.</p>\n<p>Maybe we chose the wrong firm or worked with people not experienced enough with an international, startup market. Regardless of the reason, we only barely inched along.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we were forced to go out on our own to create brand awareness and ignite public interest.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Big Guys</strong></h2>\n<p>This time, we aimed for the big guys and landed one on our own. Coverage on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2012/04/10/lets-make-a-deal-exploreb2b-social-network-goes-global/\">GigaOM</a>&nbsp;inspired positive feedback surrounding our concept and functionality. But as it turns out, getting highly coveted coverage is not enough. What happens is this: you get a spike of traffic, a couple of hundred or even thousands of visits for a day, but only a fraction of the traffic persists.</p>\n<p>PR can work if you manage to stay continually on the radar of journalists. We did not succeed in getting enough “coverable” news out over and over again and thus faced the problem of limited exposure.</p>\n<p>After personal and fired efforts, what did we learn?</p>\n<h2><strong>Our PR still stank.</strong></h2>\n<p>Without a celebrity investor or seven-figure financial round each month, we were forced to do what startups do best: build something from nothing, by using what we had.</p>\n<p>Looking back, this hardship turned out to be a great thing for our business development. Without being able to rely on press coverage, we were forced to learn and engage in a marketing strategy - to find other ways to generate traffic and convert our target audience.</p>\n<p>Essentially, our lukewarm PR made us better entrepreneurs.</p>\n<h2><strong>How, exactly, did we manage to grow?</strong></h2>\n<p>As a social publishing and content marketing platform we decided to do exactly what we had been advising our target group to do: run a content-based, social media campaign. The steps were as follows:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<em>Research our target group:&nbsp;</em>This involved getting to know the habits and motivations of our target group within each social media and online channel. It also required us to understand the conversations that were talking place about issues relevant to our service and knowing what our industry influencers were saying. Specific to our success, were analyzing Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<em>Connect with influencers:</em>&nbsp;Connecting with influencers allowed us to learn the language of our industry and lay the foundation for future interaction. When we later began to produce content, we could guest post on these influencers’ blogs/websites and involve them in a series of interviews. In both cases, we found ways to expose ourselves to their followers.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;<em>Create content of utility:</em>&nbsp;We knew that content had to be informative and engaging. Yet, the content that really made a difference for us was that which offered our platform and social media communities a sense of utility. If our content could be used to better understand the industry or tackle a common problem, it was more likely to be shared and discussed.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;<em>Publish content:</em>&nbsp;This was when we had the opportunity to do what we had been advising our target group to do the whole time:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.exploreb2b.com\">publish on exploreB2B</a>. Not only did we publish articles on our platform, we guest posted on active and relevant sites and blogs.</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;<em>Distribute content:&nbsp;</em>Publishing content was only one step of the battle. Distributing the totality of our content through our social communities served to create leads to our platform and, in turn, grow these subsidiary networks.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;<em>Continue to grow online communities</em>: This was one of the largest factors in our spike in traffic and referrals. Once we grew our Twitter accounts and initiated daily interaction in LinkedIn groups, whole communities of like-minded people were exposed to – and became familiar with – our brand name. Growing our Twitter account from miniscule numbers to five-figure followers became a powerful increase in our visibility. Even though we are B2B, this kind of “social branding” played a large role in our growth.</p>\n<p>Through a campaign of trial and error, we learned that social media and content marketing success is not immediate – and that it is not the result of one magical post. The persistence of our actions and the combination of the different measures resulted in a social media following, trust in our content, visibility, and stable platform growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>What were our end results with PR?</strong></h2>\n<p>1. A spike in traffic during April 2012.</p>\n<p>Yes, that’s it. And it was smaller than our current (steady) growth rates.</p>\n<h2><strong>What were our end results with content marketing?</strong></h2>\n<p>1. Brand awareness.</p>\n<p>2. Connection to key, industry influencers.</p>\n<p>3. Large and active social media followings on more than one network.</p>\n<p>4. Trust in our useful and engaging content.</p>\n<p>5. An increase in weekly visits by a factor of ten.</p>\n<p>6. An increase in registrations by a factor of ten.</p>\n<p>In the few months we have spent content marketing, we have achieved something that gives much more value to our company than traffic spikes created by media coverage. We have an ongoing dialogue with our users, a network base that constantly returns to our site, and consistently grow our traffic.</p>\n<p>Results from our content marketing campaign far outweigh any benefits we gained from being covered in the press.</p>\n<p>We have survived by making ourselves the leaders of our own movement, utilizing the platform we created, employing the marketing strategy we recommend and connecting to thought leaders in our field.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/clip_image002.jpg\"><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/clip_image002_thumb.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"clip_image002\" title=\"clip_image002\" width=\"244\" height=\"117\"></a></p>\n<p>Weekly traffic of exploreB2B from March 2012 to November 2012</p>\n<p>Though our content marketing results were not instant, we were able to use this time to build trust and establish a reputation in “social business.”</p>\n<p>With positive user feedback and a steady increase in their own article production, we now sense real stability in our social media and platform interactions.</p>\n<h2><strong>At this point in time, our PR still sucks.</strong></h2>\n<p>But, maybe that is just the point. It is due to the fact that our PR was not successful that we attained something that has proven more valuable in the end: steady, self-achieved, and sustainable growth.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Fate of Your Brand</strong></h2>\n<p>My advice for startup growth is to not rely on press to determine your market reputation. Instead, formulate a connection to your target group members by telling your own stories and sharing knowledge that defines your industry leadership. This provides a foundation for your own means of security and growth.</p>\n<p>Using methods such as social media and content marketing, figure out where you can reach your target group and pursue them in helpful and entertaining ways. It’s not the tech journalists, bloggers and authors covering your competitors who protect and ensure the bottom line of your company.</p>\n<p>In the end, it comes down to the people who trust&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>and find value in your ideas to decide the fate of your brand.</p>\n<p><em>This was a guest post by Susanna Gebauer. &nbsp;She is one of the founders of the social publishing and content marketing platform,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.exploreb2b.com\"><em>exploreB2B</em></a><em>.

There were supposed to be 30. &nbsp;But, two more recounts, and I was fairly certain that there was $3,000 in the envelope.&nbsp; This was the closest I think I've come to feeling like I was doing something illicit.&nbsp; I was just waiting for a police officer to walk up to the car and tap on my window.</p>\n<p>I was scheduled to&nbsp;hand this cash over to people I had never met.&nbsp; At 7pm.&nbsp; In a classroom at MIT's Stata Center (it's the building that Frank Gehry designed that looks like it came out of a Dr. Seuss book)</p>\n<p>The $3,001 was payment for what was intended to be an inbound marketing contest.&nbsp; The funny thing is, I inadvertently ended up running a hacker contest. &nbsp;But, looking on the bright side, the payment&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;have gone as high as&nbsp;$50,000 (which would have maybe required a black briefcase and sunglasses).&nbsp; So in some sense, I got off easy. &nbsp;\"This could have been much, much worse,\" I told myself.<img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mit-stata-center.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mit-stata-center\" align=\"right\"></p>\n<p>Here's the story of how I ended up handing an envelope full of $100 bills to two complete strangers.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Founder's Journey Class at MIT</strong></h2>\n<p>Back when I was a grad student at MIT (this is back in the 2005/2006 timeframe), I took a class called “New Enterprises” with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/people/zolot/\">Ken Zolot</a>&nbsp;and Howard Anderson.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;class to take if you were a student at MIT and&nbsp;had entrepreneurial leanings.&nbsp; It's where I wrote the original business plan for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.HubSpot.com\">HubSpot</a>&nbsp;(the only business plan I've ever written).</p>\n<p>Ken Zolot went on to teach a new class called&nbsp;“<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/founders/www/\">Founder's Journey</a>” (6.933) .&nbsp; Students were primarily undergrad computer science majors.&nbsp; Ken invited me in as a guest speaker, and I've been a regular guest lecturer ever since.</p>\n<p>My topic at this guest lecture &nbsp;has generally been&nbsp;<a href=\"http://inboundbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">inbound marketing</a>.&nbsp; To make things fun and interesting, I often hold a small contest/exercise during class (I've done this in other classes I teach as well).&nbsp; The cash prize was generally between $20 and $100 (usually based on how much cash I had in my pocket at the time, and the nature of the exercise). &nbsp;It often involved some sort of inbound marketing task: &nbsp;Write a title for this blog post, figure out some SEO keywords for this company, etc.</p>\n<h2>&nbsp;“<strong>Hey, why don't we make this more interesting…”</strong></h2>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>A week before I was scheduled to speak to the current&nbsp;Fall term class of “Founder's Journey”, Ken reached out to me and suggested we might want to try a more “in-depth” exercise.&nbsp; Something the students would have a few days to complete, instead of a few minutes in class.&nbsp; I thought that was a good idea, and noodled on the idea a bit.&nbsp; I then sent Ken this fateful email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/zolot-email.png\" border=\"3\" alt=\"Zolot-email\"></p>\n<p>I will summarize the rules for you:&nbsp; Each student first sets a goal for themselves in terms of how many retweets they're trying to get.&nbsp; They then try to post a tweet that gets that many (or more) retweets.&nbsp; Simple enough, right?</p>\n<p>Now, the astute among you will immediately recognize&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;issues with this proposal:</p>\n<p><strong>1. I don't&nbsp;specify a maximum payout.</strong></p>\n<p>At the time, what I had in my head was: “It's kinda hard to get people to retweet something that much.&nbsp; I have 160,000+ followers on twitter, and even one of my popular tweets might get 100–200 retweets.”&nbsp; None of these students is going to have that kind of following, ergo, the likely payout will be $20 –&nbsp; $50.&nbsp; And, if someone's really good and gets a couple of hundred retweets, so be it.</p>\n<p><strong>2. I'm not explicit about what methods are considered legitimate/fair to acquire the retweets.</strong></p>\n<p>My topic was inbound marketing, and part of what I was hoping to&nbsp; teach/convey is that a) it's hard to get people to retweet.&nbsp; b) it helps to experiment with different kinds of tweets (humorous, useful, controversial, social good, etc.)</p>\n<p>What ended up happening was this “perfect storm” of mistakes in structuring this exercise/contest.</p>\n<p><strong>“I thought to myself:&nbsp; Self, we have a problem…”</strong></p>\n<p>So, on Thursday night (t minus 6 days to the class), tweets with the #foundersjourney starting showing up on my radar.&nbsp; Not surprising.&nbsp; That's the evening the class is held, so Ken had&nbsp;clearly given the students their&nbsp;assignment and the game was on.</p>\n<p>Several of the tweets&nbsp;were amusing, like this one:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/founders-journey-tweet-1.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Founders-journey-tweet-1\"></p>\n<p>But, when I saw this tweet, I knew I had a potential problem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/founders-journey-tweet-2.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Founders-journey-tweet-2\"></p>\n<p>Uh oh.&nbsp; Exactly 300 retweets (as stated in the tweet) — all of them looking like bots.&nbsp; That's when I thought to myself, “Self, we have a problem…”&nbsp; I realized that I had not explicitly stated that one couldn't set up a robot army to do the re-tweeting (that kind of defeats the whole purpose&nbsp; of the exercise, which was meant to be about&nbsp;<em>inbound marketing</em>).&nbsp; But, the rules are the rules.&nbsp; I had set myself up, and was prepared to pay the price.</p>\n<p>Now, I just needed to figure out what that price was going to be.&nbsp; So, I sent an email to Ken to ask the simple question: What were the top 5 retweet bids/projections?&nbsp; (Remember, per the rules, I wouldn't have to pay out any more than what someone had bid).</p>\n<p>\"The top bids are: 50,000, 11,000, 10,000, 5,000, and 3,000\", he said. &nbsp;“Holy crap!”, I thought.&nbsp; This is going to get interesting.</p>\n<p>Later, I saw this tweet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/founders-journey-tweet-3.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Founders-journey-tweet-3\"></p>\n<p>The tweet didn't have 3,259 retweets at the time — but it was climbing steadily.&nbsp; The contest ran for 3 days, and as you might expect, I watched intently as the story unfolded.</p>\n<p>Once the contest ended, I knew I was likely going to be out a fair amount of money.&nbsp; I didn't know how much, because I didn't know what Paul's bid was.&nbsp; But, I had a sneaking suspicion it was going to be relatively close to the 3,259 bid.</p>\n<p>So, I figured, what the hell — let me just reach out to this guy and get the skinny.&nbsp; It's also when I had the idea to write this blog article.&nbsp; I figured “Hey, maybe we can turn this into somewhat of a happy inbound marketing ending. ”&nbsp; I later learned that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://twitter.com/thepaulbooth\">Paul</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/timcameronryan\">Tim</a>&nbsp;(a classmate) had agreed to join forces and attack the challenge together.</p>\n<h2><strong>30, Fresh, Crisp, $100 Bills</strong></h2>\n<p>So, last night (Tuesday, December 5<sup>th</sup>), I went in to teach the Founder's Journey class (as scheduled).&nbsp; I met Paul and Tim for the first time, handed them an envelope with 30, crisp $100 bills, while their classmates looked on with a combination of admiration and envy, and then went about my business of convincing a bunch of undergrad computer science students that marketing was usually necessary, and that inbound marketing was the way to go about it.</p>\n<p>Paul tweeted a picture of the cash later that night.&nbsp; Here's that picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mit-founders-journey-cash.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Mit-founders-journey-cash\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's a video of them hacking away (don't worry, there's no sound, so it's safe for work -- or classrooms</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"313\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/54922480?badge=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>CAPTCHAs, consoles and cash, Oh my!</strong></p>\n<p>I went ahead did an email interview (this is all before I actually met the guys).&nbsp; Here are the questions I asked, and their responses.&nbsp; Only minor editing..and I've added some of my thoughts in italics.</p>\n<div>\n<div><strong></strong>\n<p><strong>1. How did you pick 3,000 as your bid/projection?</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;First of all, my bid is 3,001. I wanted to be able to say that I won \"over $3000.\" Secondly, I wanted something worth doing. I realized that I got to set how successful this could be, so I didn't want to limit myself. I thought was about the most I could get away with in 3 days.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;So I picked 460, knowing I could probably get comfortably to that amount without raising any red flags. Once Paul mentioned he picked 3,000, the choice was between solving 2,500 captchas for no benefit… or getting a piece of the action. (Paul, of course, was nice enough to collaborate.)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div><strong></strong>\n<p><strong>2. At the time you submitted your bid, had you already thought about some sort of semi-automated approach?</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;My first idea was that some service must already exist to turn money into retweets, and I could just buy them for less than a dollar each. I tried&nbsp;&nbsp;one of them&nbsp;with the ten free retweets, and they took about a day and a half to roll in. Too slow, I would need to make my own solution.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;I was stoked when the contest rules were proposed. I wasn't sure if we were going to automate it at first; but I knew it was feasible, and intentionally asked no questions so that nothing would be off the table.&nbsp; (This was smart.&nbsp; No upside to asking a bunch of questions about the rules -Dharmesh)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>3. How much software was involved in the process? &nbsp;What did the software actually do?</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;The software did everything except solve the captcha. It scrapes the twitter mobile signup page for the captcha picture, saves that after running edge detection to make it even easier, and displays that on a constantly refreshing page. Type 6 numbers in the console, press enter, repeat. One twitter account after another.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;After our setup, had a script which would access mobile Twitter, generate a random First + Last name from dictionary words (\"Rumply Nectarines\"), pick the first Twitter-suggested username (@rumply) and then download a captcha. To us, this was just a page which showed a number, we'd type six numbers, [enter], and the next image pops up.&nbsp;The new account credentials are saved, so five hours later, we just had to run \"retweet_this.py [tweet id]\" once and slowly refresh our browser as the number ticked up. At about 3am we got our networks blocked, and we started tickling out retweets over my phone connection, slowly inching past 2500 and hoping not to get blocked again... (My guess is that if their network continued to get blocked, they would have found a proxy server somewhere to get around it. -Dharmesh)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>4. What was the software developed in? &nbsp;Did you use any third-party libraries for some of the low-level stuff?</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;We used Node.js which we've both used for a lot of personal projects. We used a really cool library called scrapi which did all the heavy lifting for us (and which Tim authored :D).</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;Just Node.js for scraping, and Imagemagick to resize and highlight the edges of the captcha. (Paul disagreed this made it easier. We had about five hours to micro-optimize the whole process). I think it's amazing what you can accomplish with just an HTTP client and no rate limiting.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>5. How do you and Tim know each other?</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;We go way back, since we were first-years at Olin. We made a lua-running operating system together, made a product designed for LARPers, and we share a provisional patent for a physical identity device as part of Lifegraph Labs that we are running this year with 4 other students. I wanted someone to help make this a reality, and I couldn't think of anyone more qualified than my friend Tim who is also in #foundersjourney. It &nbsp;really worked out for both of us.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;We both attend Olin College, and not only is Olin small, but Paul and I have known and worked with each other on a ton of projects over the past four years, a large number of them gags and things we're terribly embarrassed to talk about. Our shining moment may have been an OS we coded from scratch, just to display pictures of ASCII cats.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>6. Had you worked on something similar before?</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've never had to make 3000+ Twitterbots, but I have scraped twitter for data for AI research projects and I think we've both had our lion's share of Stay Late And Code projects.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;Paul and I have done hacks like this before, but the timing was funny.&nbsp;I'm currently researching easy and flexible ways to consume APIs and websites.&nbsp;This scraper was built on a library I'd been working on for a few months [1].&nbsp;Hacker News had a heated discussion last month around Marco's article \"What Happens When a Twitter Client Hits the Token Limit\" (<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4795052\" target=\"_blank\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4795052</a>). Scraping as a panacea for Twitter API restrictions was brought up in the comments, and as a proof-of-concept I thought I would bang out something to parse Twitter's mobile client, just to test how easy it would be to use Twitter without an API. Not long after, this contest was announced. Good timing, I guess!

Even better would be adding a fully automated captcha solver that someone else wrote that works most or some of the time. That's a great step 2 for this project, and next time we won't be doing this manually.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;Mechanical Turk's turnaround would be too slow, plus, better not violate Amazon's TOS&nbsp;and&nbsp;Twitter's. There are captcha solvers available online for cheap ($5 for 1000) but by this point we had paid no money and automated most of the work. It felt slightly less dishonest if we did all the grueling work ourselves.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>8. You don't know me from Adam, how did you know I was going to make good on the offer?</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;I figured that since you proposed the challenge in the first place, you would be a good sport about it. I figured it would be great for your reputation if you paid out, and maybe not so good if you didn't. In the end, we weren't going lose more than a day programming and typing captchas, and the promise of a story this exciting was too good to pass up.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong>Tim:</strong>&nbsp;Can 3,000 Twitter bots get #dharmeshisaliar trending on Twitter? ;) Questioning the payout didn't even come up. &nbsp;More worrisome was that someone would honestly (or dishonestly) beat us. We did the math; we solved 15 captchas a minute, so that's $900/hr, for five hours, with the risk we might get zero payout. That's a better lottery ticket than I've ever bought. It'll be fun Christmas shopping.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><em>For the record, I was going to make the pay out regardless of what the outcome was.&nbsp; A deal's a deal.&nbsp; I'm just glad I didn't have to pay out $50,000.&nbsp; That would have stung a bit (because I could have angel&nbsp;invested that kind of money in two up-and-coming startups!) –&nbsp; Dharmesh</em></div>\n<div><em><br></em></div>\n<h2><strong>Closing thoughts and lessons learned</strong></h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>1. If you ever hold a contest with a bunch of MIT undergrad computer science students, assume that it's ultimately going to become a hacking contest.&nbsp; Hackers hack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>2. Remember that any game that can be gamed will be gamed.&nbsp; All part of the fun.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>3. It's wise to actually state in the contest guidelines what the&nbsp;<em>intent</em>&nbsp;of the exercise is.&nbsp; This will likely increase the chances that you get what you set out to get. &nbsp;In this case, the irony was that I care&nbsp;<em>immensely</em>&nbsp;about inbound marketing, and I was worried that the students would walk away with the exact wrong lesson. &nbsp;But, I think by the time my class was done, they \"got it\".</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p>4.

The topic was \"Technical Interviews\".&nbsp; The idea was to share ideas and best practices across the product team so that we can better find and recruit great developers for the team. &nbsp;&nbsp;HubSpot has had a bit of an unfair advantage when it comes to technical recruiting.&nbsp; We're fortunate to have Paul English, founder/CTO as a friend (he's hands down the best recruiter I've ever met). &nbsp;Paul was kind enough to be \"CTO for a day\" at HubSpot. &nbsp;And, because Google Ventures is an investor, we've been able to have a Googler from their recruiting team spend a few hours with us, reviewing our practices and giving us tips for how we can improve them. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ideas for Creating An Awesome Candidate Experience (CX)</h2>\n<p>Here are some ideas for what I think would make a great candidate experience. &nbsp;Many of these ideas are implemented at HubSpot -- and I'm hoping the others will get adopted too. &nbsp;We have some work to do ourselves, but we're passionate about <a href=\"http://bostonbattle.com\" title=\"building an amazing product team in Boston\" target=\"_self\">building an amazing product team in Boston</a>.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Decide to do it</strong>.&nbsp; The first step in creating a great candidate experience (CX) is deciding that it's important.&nbsp; Just like you'd commit time and energy for creating a great UX for your product, you need to devote some calories to iterating on your CX and working had to make it exceptional.&nbsp; There are a number of reasons you should do this:</p>\n<p>a) Recruiting great people is hard -- and competitive.&nbsp; All things being equal, on average, if you can make the candidate experience better, you win.&nbsp; People will often take positions with lesser known companies simply because they had a great interviewing experience.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Focus on the entire experience</strong>.&nbsp; Designing a great candidate experience is not just about doing interviews well.&nbsp; A great CX starts from the moment a person connects with your company (like your website) all the way through the point that they are delivered a decision -- and every step in between.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Measure it to improve it</strong>.&nbsp; It's not possible to create a great CX without getting feedback from candidates.&nbsp; What I'd suggest is a simple NPS (Net Promoter Score) style survey at the end of the candidate interviewing process.&nbsp; The survey asks exactly two questions:</p>\n<p>a) On a scale of 0-10 how likely are you to recommend that a friend or family member interview here?</p>\n<p>b) Why did you give us that score?</p>\n<p>You don't have to use these specific questions -- the benefit is that NPS is that it is simple, and widely used as a way to measure customer satisfaction (or more accurately, customer delightion). &nbsp; We use NPS in a variety of ways at HubSpot -- including measuring the happiness of our customers and team members.</p>\n<p>Some quick notes on collecting this feedback:&nbsp; First, It should be collected before a final decision is delivered, so you get unbiased data.&nbsp; Second, it should be made clear to the candidate that they are doing you a favor.&nbsp; There's no harm in telling a candidate exactly why you're asking for this feedback.&nbsp; In almost all cases, the candidate would likely see this as a positive signal. &nbsp;It shows that you care.</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Interviews are both a buying and selling process</strong>.&nbsp; One of the mistakes inexperienced interviewers often make is behaving as if their job is only to \"be convinced\" by the candidate that they'd make a good hire.&nbsp; As a result, they often have an \"edge\", aren't particularly friendly, and don't do enough to make the&nbsp;candidate feeel comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That can be a bit disconcerting for the candidate, and creates a sub-optimal candidate experience. &nbsp;As an interviewer, your job is two-fold:&nbsp; One, make a rational judgment as to whether you think this person would be a good hire for the team.&nbsp; Two, ensure that the candidate wants to work at your company.&nbsp; It's both a buying and a selling process (not just buying).&nbsp; As it turns out, great people always have options. &nbsp;Even if they're not a good fit and you decide not to hire -- you want them to leave with as positive an impression as possible. &nbsp;They may have friends or family that are better fits. &nbsp;<strong>Quick mental hack: &nbsp;Pretend like every candidate you don't hire is going to become a future potential user/customer</strong>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. <b>Be at least a bit organized. &nbsp;</b>Yes, you're a startup. &nbsp;Yes, everyone's already working away furiously and interviews are often an unwelcome irritant. &nbsp;But, that's our problem -- not the candidate's problem. &nbsp;Spend some time devising at least a simple process to ensure that meetings are scheduled appropriately, the candidate knows what the process is (and how long they'll need to be there) and always, always, always make sure they're feeling comfortable and welcome. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. <b>Make speed a feature. &nbsp;</b>Just like great UX, a great CX is about speed. &nbsp;Faster is always better. &nbsp;I've never met someone that thought: &nbsp;\"Boy, am I glad those folks took 2 weeks to get back to me on an answer...\". &nbsp;</p>\n<p>7. <strong>Have a \"guest\" tablet available for candidates. &nbsp;</strong>Make sure it's already on your WiFi network, the home page in the browser is your company website. &nbsp;The idea is to give the candidates something productive to occupy their time with while they're waiting. &nbsp;They can even play Angry Birds, if they want. &nbsp;Nothing's worse than sitting in reception, not knowing what the guest WiFi password is, and having to twiddle one's thumbs before an interview.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>Don't repeat the same topics. &nbsp;</strong>Be organized enough that if the candidate is going to go through multiple interviews, you don't have them cover the same topics multiple times. &nbsp;That's annoying and a waste of time. &nbsp;If one interview focuses on their front-end development skills and how well they really understand jQuery, then perhaps the other interview should be more about work style and thoughts on team collaboration.</p>\n<p>9. <b>Have a clear feedback/rating system. &nbsp; </b>You need to have a clear internal rating system so that interviewers can express their overall take. &nbsp;If the person is an absolute no-hire, that should be clear. &nbsp;So, your scale could be: &nbsp;absolutely no hire, leaning against, neutral, leaning in favor, absolutely hire them. &nbsp;One important point while we're on this topic: &nbsp;The rating scale is not about the person -- it's about whether this person should be made an offer at this point in time. &nbsp;I've sometimes seen people give a \"high\" rating (because the person was really, really good -- and interviewed really well), but then later heard \"but I wouldn't hire them.\" &nbsp;The reason for the interviews is to make a hiring decision. &nbsp;Said differently, <strong>the ultimate return value of the function is a boolean hire/no-hire NOT awesome/good/not-so-good person</strong>.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Learn something. &nbsp;</strong>Make every effort to <em>learn something</em>&nbsp;from every candidate. &nbsp;Just because you're on this side of the hiring table and just because you may be more experienced does not mean you can't learn something from every candidate. &nbsp;You can. Try to draw out a particular passion that the candidate has. &nbsp;Perhaps a recent epic debugging victory. &nbsp;Or, why their editor is the One True Editor To Rule Them All. &nbsp;Doesn't matter what the topic. &nbsp;Find what they're passionate about, and genuinely get them to teach you something about it. &nbsp;(If they're not passionate about anything, you've got a problem).</p>\n<p>11. <strong>Teach something. &nbsp;</strong>Whether the candidate gets an offer or not, they should have learned something from you. &nbsp;They need to walk out smarter than they walked in. &nbsp;(Note: This does not mean you spend 50% of the interview telling them about the proper Pythonic way to do something).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>12. <strong>Be transparent. &nbsp;</strong>Make the conversation open. &nbsp;Let the candidate ask questions that are on their mind. &nbsp;It could be about team dynamics, work style/hours, financials (growth, cash, etc.), product strategy, dev philosophy, whatever. &nbsp;Be honest. &nbsp;If there are some things you can't answer, be honest about that. &nbsp;But, try to be as transparent as possible -- it makes for a much better candidate experience.</p>\n<p>13. <strong>No leading of the witnesses. &nbsp;</strong>If you're having multiple people interview a candidate, you need to make sure that the early interviewer(s) don't unduly influence the later ones. &nbsp;This is important for a couple of reasons: &nbsp;One, <strong>you want multiple viewpoints, not the same viewpoint multiple times</strong>. &nbsp;Second, from the candidate's perspective, if they feel like they got off on the wrong foot in the first interview, you want them to have a reasonable chance of showing off their awesomeness in the subsequent interviews. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Warning: Controversial Idea coming up: &nbsp;</strong>One of the top areas of debate regarding technical interviewing is wheter you should \"fail fast\" (or not). &nbsp;Let me set this up with an example: &nbsp;Lets say you invite a candidate in for 4 hours for a series of interviews. &nbsp;Lets say after the first interview, the interviewer is absolutely sure that this candidate is a \"no hire\". &nbsp;What do you do?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>a) Thank them for their time and stop the interview process? &nbsp;The advantage is that you're not expending further (very precious) developer time, when a decision is already made. &nbsp;The downside is that this is kind of disheartening and deflating for the candidate. &nbsp;If they were scheduled for 4 hours and you send them home after the first hour, that just doesn't feel good.</p>\n<p>b) Continue the interview process? &nbsp;The advantage is that it's (arguably) a better candidate experience. &nbsp;You might even suggest that the later interviewers might like the candidate so much that they convince the first interviewer to change their mind. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>My general leaning is not completely cut-off the interview process. &nbsp;Having said that, there are a few things I'd try: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>i) One, when inviting candidates in, make it a time range instead of an absolute number of hours. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;Please schedule 3-4 hours for your visit. &nbsp;That way, you could reasonably end the interviews without going through the full \"maximum\" time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;ii) Build a reputation for being super-selective, but fair. &nbsp;Be honest and open about this in the early conversations. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>iii) <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Consider offering a $100 Amazon gift card for \"early exits\". &nbsp;Be transparent and honest. &nbsp;\"I just don't think we have a good fit here and doesn't make sense to put you through more interviews.</span>\" &nbsp;UPDATE: I reconsidered this one. &nbsp;The more I thought about it, the cheesier it sounded. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>14. <strong>Get them to code, but let them pick the language</strong>. &nbsp;Coding exercises are a critical part of the interviewing prcoess. &nbsp;There is no substitute for getting a candidate to do a quick coding exercise (either on a computer or on a whiteboard). &nbsp;The intent for this exercise is not to test proficiency with a particular language -- but to see if they can \"think in code\" -- and how they go about doing it. &nbsp;My advice is to let the candidate pick whatever language they're comfortable with (amongst the mainstream languages available, like Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, etc.). &nbsp;Any of these mainstream languages are more than powerful enough for a coding exercise, and even if you're not completely proficient in a langauge, you'll still get a sense for how the person goes about thinking about a problem and manifesting a solution in code.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>15. <b>Do a friendly follow-up after the offer. &nbsp;</b>Generally, you'll have someone extend the offer in some formal or semi-formal form. &nbsp;In addition to that, have one of the designated interviewers follow-up with a quick email (perhaps with a \"cc\" to the others they met). &nbsp;Something like: &nbsp;\"Hey, thanks for vistiing HubSpot. &nbsp;We'd be thrilled to have you join our merry band. &nbsp;If you ever want to grab coffee or a bite to eat, just drop me a note. &nbsp;I should probably tear myself away from the computer every now and then anyways...\"</p>\n<h2>What's Your Take?</h2>\n<p>Whew! &nbsp;That was a much longer article than I originally intended. &nbsp;Now, it's your turn. &nbsp;What do you think would make a great candidate experience?

I hate them. My aversion borders on the pathological.</p>\n<p>You will find this surprising and abnormal (because it is), but in a given <em>year</em>, I'll usually have &lt; 15 non-personal phone calls. I often go weeks and weeks without a single call (joy! bliss!) When I do have them, I have to emotionally prepare myself. And, just so you know, I have a tough time with personal calls too, much to the disappointment of my mom and dad, who live in India.</p>\n<p>Hence, this article, which you can find at <a href=\"http://sorrynocalls.com/\">SorryNoCalls.com</a> (domain setup to make it easy to reference. I might even print it on my business cards some day).</p>\n<p><strong>Why I Hate Phone Calls</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the reasons why I hate phone calls so much. The snips shown below are from an absolutely fantastic comic titled “<a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/phone\">10 Reasons To Avoid Talking On The Phone</a>” by Matthew Inman of <a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com\" title=\"The Oatmeal\" target=\"_self\">The Oatmeal</a>. I've pulled the few segments that particularly resonated for me.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. I don't like synchronous communications.</strong></h2>\n<p>A phone calls is a synchronous conversation. It breaks up my day and interrupts my flow. That's why I much prefer email, which I can “batch up” and do all at once, at my leisure and on my schedule. Handling things asynchronously also allows me to be more thoughtful about my response and match my degree of response to the importance of the situation. On a phone call, it seems rude to go into a long, detailed diatribe (even though the situation seemingly warrants it), because the other party doesn't have an easy way to “fast forward” (or skip). With email, I can write up my thoughts, get into detail if I want, with the knowledge that if the other person's not as interested as I thought, they can just move on.</p>\n<h2>2. <strong>I hate making small talk.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr><a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/phone\" target=\"_self\"><img id=\"img-1353425361469\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/no-calls-small-talk.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"no calls small talk\" class=\"alignCenter\" style=\"border: 3px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a><hr>\n<p>Even when it's in person, small talk is difficult. On the phone, it's even harder.</p>\n<p>I'm an introvert. Not somewhat of an introvert. A complete introvert. And from what I've heard, it's not uncommon for introverts to not like small talk. I'm not sure exactly why that is for other introverts, but for me it's because it feels fake and I can't figure out what the right level of small talk is to be polite. I constantly feel awkward when I'm engaging in small talk, because I'm constantly trying to figure out in the back of my head, when it's OK to move into the “real” conversation.</p>\n<h2>3. <strong>I have a really hard time saying “no”.</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr><a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/phone\" target=\"_self\"><img id=\"img-1353426028443\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/no-calls-cant-say-no.png\" border=\"1\" alt=\"no calls cant say no\" class=\"alignCenter\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a><hr>\n<p>In many business conversations, someone's often selling and someone's often buying. Over the years, I discovered that if I'm on a call, I'm usually on the “buy” side. And, I'm terrible at saying no generally, but particularly bad doing it in real-time, especially when I can't <em>see</em> the other person. (You'd think it'd be easier to say no when the other person can't see you — but surprisingly, that's not true for me).</p>\n<h2>4. <strong>I'm pathologically polite, and just can't get the timing right.</strong></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr><a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/phone\" target=\"_self\"><img id=\"img-1353426040601\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/no-calls-disjointed.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"no calls disjointed\" class=\"alignCenter\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a><hr>\n<p>When on a phone call, it feels like I'm always doing this delicate dance between trying to make sure there's not the dreaded period of silence that lasts too long — and the equally dreadful experience of inadvertently interrupting someone. I do this particular dance very poorly, know I do it poorly, and as such am self-conscious about it, and so end up doing it poorly. Vicious cycle.</p>\n<h2>5. <strong>I'm absolutely terrible at ending a call.&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n&nbsp;<hr><a href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/phone\" target=\"_self\"><img id=\"img-1353426050359\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/no-calls-goodbye.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"no calls goodbye\" class=\"alignCenter\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></a>&nbsp;<hr>\n<p>So, to summarize, sorry no calls. It's not you — it's me. I know you're probably not trying to sell me something. You're probably really good at having a normal phone conversation (like most people), so you think I'm exaggerating how I feel. Trust me, I'm not.</p>\n<p>Please accept my apologies for having this strange eccentricity.</p>\n<p><strong>And, a word of thanks&nbsp;to my friends, family and colleagues. &nbsp;</strong>They've learned to accept this weakness of mine and don't take it to heart. &nbsp;I'm also thankful for the modest success I've had so far whereby I can design my life around my pecularities. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tips if you're like me:</strong></p>\n<p>1. I find it much less troublesome to schedule a call than just randomly answer the phone.</p>\n<p>2. Setup a separate phone number (using something like Google Voice) which you only give out to folks you've scheduled a call with. &nbsp;You can program Google Voice to show the dialed number as caller ID (instead of the person calling).</p>\n<p>3. To avoid the awkwardness around small-talk, try to outline what the topic of the conversation is going to be. &nbsp;It makes you feel less guilty for transitioning into the purpose of the call.</p>\n<p>4. Use email to get your high-level thoughts communicated first, and then use a phone call to add a personal touch or to have a higher bandwidth conversation.</p>\n<p>5. Make it a firm policy to never say yes to something <em>on the call</em>. &nbsp;Always give yourself some time to think about it. &nbsp;I will often tell people that I never make a buying decision on the phone -- and that they should follow-up via email. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. Change the outgoing message on your voicemail letting people know that the preferred way to reach you is by email. &nbsp;Thankfully, this stops many telemarketers.</p>\n<p>7. Remember that it's your life and you get to decide some things. &nbsp;If your work or personal life requires phone calls, that's cool. &nbsp;But, I think over 90% of the calls you'd normally take you are not obligated to take. &nbsp;<strong>We use the phone out of habit and because we think we have to.</strong></p>\n<p>So, what about you? &nbsp;Do you share my aversion for phone calls? &nbsp;Or, are you a smilin' dialin' phone callin' machine? &nbsp;What's your take?</p><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/92302/Sorry-No-Calls.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=53u39-vJFuQ:_67mxS1JqUY:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/53u39-vJFuQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/53u39-vJFuQ/Sorry-No-Calls.aspx", :published_at => Tue, 20 Nov 2012 16:12:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:92302", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

Other than being very talented developers, they all share one thing in common -- it’s unbelievably hard to bring them on-board your company. And as if competing with other companies for the same talent was not enough, being a startup just adds more challenges to the equation. Your startup may be the next Google/Facebook/Instagram, but until then - how can you convince the best developers out there to join a company where the CEO’s office is an IKEA desk? Here’s one answer -- recruit like a startup, in a creative and agile way, doing things the way big companies can’t. During the last 5 years I’ve interviewed over 250 candidates and recruited dozens of great engineers. The first interviews took place in our tiny office’s kitchen, and we still managed to convince some of the best candidates to join. There aren’t any magic tricks involved, but here are some tips and methods which helped us get ninjas, rock stars and other highly talented people on-board.</p>\n<h3>You’re a startup -- have the founders make the first contact.</h3>\nWe lose many potential candidates even before the starting line - we fail to bring them over for a first interview. Some are already talking with too many companies, or decide after a brief visit to your web-site that your startup just isn’t their thing. That’s the point where you can make a difference. Our co-founders (including myself) are in charge of sending the first e-mail to potential candidates. We’ve kept this habit even as we’ve grown. At first, I was worried some candidates may think we have too much free time on our hands (sadly, we don’t). I soon found out that when candidates receive a personal and flattering e-mail (important when it comes to star developers) from a co-founder, it sends a message that this startup is all about its employees. Here are some helpful points for writing the first email: <a href=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_emailToFutureHire.png\"><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/02_emailToFutureHire-300x184.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"02_emailToFutureHire\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-13\"></a>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Link to your online profile</strong> (personal blog, an interview with you, a YouTube video) when introducing yourself. Once there’s a face behind the email you’re more likely to get a positive response.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a personal touch</strong>. Have other employees who went to the same college? Mention it. Grew up in the same town? Write it down. It might sound irrelevant, but it creates the first hook, enough to have them come over for a meeting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Interviewing: It’s not just about the role, it’s also about who they will have lunch with.</h3>\nWhile we tend to tell candidates everything about the role, the managers and the company, there’s one part that’s usually missing - who will they work with? One of the most common answers I get when asking people why they've chosen one job over the other is knowing other employees there. Let candidates know who'll be sitting next to their (IKEA) desk and sharing their 9GAG jokes.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When candidates come for an interview we try to have them meet at least one future co-worker.</strong> A candidate asks a good tech question during the interview? Refer him to the engineer working on it instead of answering yourself. Found out the candidate has something in common with one of the employees (skydiving, growing up in Ohio, have a thing for ASCII art)? Introduce them. It’s not something we plan ahead, but given the opportunity, having the candidate stay at the office after the interview chatting with other employees, is considered a success.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t interview too early or too late during the day, when the office is empty.</strong> If the only time your future star can come in for an interview is 8:00am, make sure some people come early. You want to paint a full picture of what it will be like working at your startup.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/03_office-1024x382.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"03_office\" width=\"464\" height=\"173\" class=\" wp-image-14 \">[You don’t need a fancy office to make good impression - the small details do the job. Our entrance door has code on it and these are our meeting room custom coasters ]\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Interviewing: Choose carefully which opportunity to pitch.</h3>\nThere truly are great things about joining a startup - new technological challenges, opportunities for moving up the ladder more quickly, learning about the business side of things, stock options and more. Don’t sell them all at once. Pitching becoming a manager to an engineer who just wants to experiment with new technologies? Bzzzz -- wrong move -- which might send her elsewhere.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look back</strong> - When we first started interviewing we used to ask candidates what they’re looking for. Instead of sharing their true motivations, they answered with what they thought was the ‘right’ answer -- “I just want to work on interesting stuff”. After a while we discovered the magic trick; instead of asking what they’re looking for now, we began asking how they've made previous job decisions. When asked about past decisions, people tend to share what really matters to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don’t pitch, give examples</strong> - You can’t really promise someone that he or she will become a manager in the future, or only work on interesting stuff. Instead, I tell candidates what talented people who've joined the company a year ago are doing now. This could be how an engineer with no previous management experience is already heading a small team, or how a developer straight out of college is doing such a great job we’ve put her in charge of some very key algorithms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img src=\"http://dharmeshshah.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/04_pitchTopics-1024x411.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"04_pitchTopics\" width=\"580\" height=\"232\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15\"></h3>\n<h3>Signing: How to make candidates sign an employment agreement more quickly.</h3>\nYou've reached the homestretch. The candidate you really liked said yes, and now all is left is to sign the employment agreement. This can turn into a very risky period. The current employer is likely to come with a counter offer and so can other companies.\n<ul>\n<li>Important: Avoid having your future star waste time on legal issues. To help with this we've decided to have the exact same employment agreement for everyone in the company. Other than the terms themselves, everything is the same - from the number of vacation days down to the small letters. It’s a super friendly agreement and we never change it. Once I tell candidates that everyone -- the CEO, the engineers and myself have all signed the exact same contract, and therefore we can’t change it, it usually takes them only a day or two to sign it. There’s much less need to re-read every part.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Weiss from A16Z shares a great tip about the pre-signing period with the ‘<a href=\"http://scott.a16z.com/2012/06/04/guerilla-recruiting-combating-the-counteroffer/\" title=\"Welcome Basket\" target=\"_blank\">Welcome basket</a>’.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>How to hear ‘No” and how to say ‘No’</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hearing No - Stay in touch with good candidates who chose a different company over yours.</strong> When a candidate I really like accepts a different offer over ours I always get the feeling I was dumped. True, I can’t honestly say I don’t understand how can someone pick a great job at Google over a small and unknown startup, but it still hurts. While the easiest thing to do after hearing a ‘No’ is, well, nothing, I try to make one last effort to stay in the picture. There are two main reasons for it : 1). Startups grow quickly. You might have a good candidate who decided a 10 employee company is not for him/her but a year or two later as your company grows it will become much more attractive. 2). Receiving a negative answer usually means you've reached second place. Sometimes, the first choice doesn't turn out to be the dream job they were hoping for. Some candidates don’t feel comfortable getting back in touch after they gave you a negative answer. By making the first move you’re saying that everything is fine and we’re still interested in you. Yes, it’s very much like dating. How to keep yourself in the picture? I like to send FB friend requests to candidates, and that’s something that you can do only as a startup (it can get pretty awkward when done by someone from a large company). Facebook is a great platform to share how well your startup is doing over the years. I also like sending an email once every 4-6 months, sharing how we’re doing and asking how’s everything going. I found out that most people find it friendly (and somehow flattering) rather than annoying.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saying No - giving a smart negative answer will help you reach other great engineers in the future</strong>. I often ask myself how I would have liked to receive a “No”. My answer is that I would like to hear the truth. Instead of using the default answer of “we've decided to continue the process with someone else”, I write the (sometime hard) truth- “You didn't pass the technical test’, ‘you don’t seem like a startup kind of guy’, ‘it seems like you’re more interested in managing and that’s something we can’t offer right now’. I also make sure to write some of the things I liked about the candidate. True, there are some cases you can’t write the real reason, but in most cases you can. I was terrified when I sent the first 100% sincere email, but I soon found out that candidates embrace this, and usually agree with the reason. Now comes the interesting part - instead of feeling rejected, most people rightly feel they interviewed for the wrong role. Once you don’t ‘break-up’ with them, you can ask them to recommend friends or co-workers they think could fit the position. Yep, it sounds crazy, but it’s true. Even if you don’t get a new lead, rest assured you’ll have a past candidate saying good things about your company, and that’s something great in itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How about you?

He previously headed Marketing and Sales at </em><a href=\"http://www.fusioncharts.com/\" title=\"Fusion Charts\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FusionCharts</em></a><em> and just launched an </em><a href=\"http://www.fusioncharts.com/story\" title=\"Fusion Charts\" target=\"_blank\"><em>eBook</em></a><em> on the complete journey of the company on its tenth birthday.</em></p>\n<p>FusionCharts was founded in 2002 by my brother, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/pallavn\" title=\"Pallav Nadhani\" target=\"_blank\">Pallav Nadhani</a>, in a quest for more pocket money. The charts people used on the web those days were Excel-type charts that were a pain to use, sat heavy on the servers often sending them crashing and burning, and generated deathly-dull output at the end of it all. FusionCharts came in with sexy, animated and interactive charts that were a breeze to use and installed the copy-paste way. Today, it has 20,000 customers and 450,000 users in 118 countries, powers more than a billion charts per month and clocks $7M in annual revenues. But that's not the interesting part. The interesting part is that this is the handiwork of a 17-year old with no business knowledge whatsoever living in India — a land that was nowhere on the product map a decade ago. In this post, I will share the unconventional problems that came our way and the lessons we learnt. Even though I moved on from FusionCharts a year back, I am still going to refer to it as \"we\" wherever required because that's how much a part of my identity it is. Also, brevity is good.<img src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/india-flag.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"india flag\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<h2>Wanting to make money is not a bad reason to start up</h2>\nAsk any entrepreneur why they started up and the reasons would vary from “The project management tool we had didn't cut it for us to “The world of education had been languishing in the dark ages for too long.” And of course, there's that thing this Steve guy said that people love to repeat — I wanted to make a dent in the universe. But “I wanted to make money” is not something you hear of often. It sounds shallow, and most entrepreneurs shy away from it. FusionCharts started as a quest for more pocket money when as a teenager, Pallav needed more money to go bowling and hang out in cafes. Creating an interactive charting library isn't world-changing. It's not even sexy. But it solved his problem of making more pocket money.\n<h2>It's not just about the product, it's the complete package</h2>\n<strong>People don't want to know what a product can do, they want to know what a product can do for them</strong>. So throwing a feature list in their face, no matter how nicely done, is not going to cut it. They need to have the <em>this is it</em>feeling as soon as they hit your website. And more so, when you are sitting in India trying to sell to Fortune 500 companies around the world. Right from the early days, FusionCharts has had real-life business demos on its website. Sales dashboards, KPI monitors, network monitoring systems, and all of them with actual business data. Of course, we could have just put out the product with an extensive feature list and expected people to give us all their money. But instead we decided to put in hours conceptualizing the demos, gathering real-life data (dirty dirty job!) and then finally implementing them. But the end result was worth the effort. Project and product managers from large enterprises would come to the website with a picture of the dashboard they need in their head, see that we have a sales dashboard, click on it and go wow. This is exactly what I am looking for. They would then ask their development team to check it out and let them know if it was good to go. So what would otherwise take three phone calls and seven emails took all of five minutes of the manager's time, and no involvement from us at all.\n<h2>Fighting fraud with freemium</h2>\nEvery time an organization is faced with a big problem, the kind that shifts the ground beneath their feet, they just start throwing resources at it. Big money, top people. But it doesn't have to be that way — big problems often have small inexpensive solutions. FusionCharts was commercially open source from day one. The idea behind making the source code available was that people would feel safe about buying from an unknown company from India. Even if FusionCharts turned out to be a fly-by-night operator or went down in crashing, burning flames for whatever reason, they could keep their charting up-to-date by building on the source code. However, this credibility-establishing factor almost spelt doom for FusionCharts. A company from Eastern Europe picked up the source code, made some small changes to it and started selling it as their own product for a cheaper price. Of course, they had to be sued. But going the legal way needed a lot of time and money, both of which FusionCharts didn't have at that point in time. So when a new version of FusionCharts was launched, the previous version was launched as FusionCharts Free. It was free to use in both personal and commercial projects, no strings attached. What the infringers were selling for slightly cheaper could be had from the original developers itself, for free. No one has tried pulling that trick ever again.\n<h2>Marketing isn't just about money</h2>\nThe release of FusionCharts Free not only helped fend off the infringers, it also helped get the FusionCharts brand name out in markets that were tough to reach otherwise. Developers who are wary of playing with a trial version, believing it comes with some gimmick, got playing with the product and liked what they saw. Some developers built plugins and wrappers around FusionCharts Free for different platforms including GWT, Drupal and Joomla. Startups, who were low on money started using the free version in their product and when they had paying customers, they came back to get the paid version. In essence, FusionCharts Free has done more marketing for FusionCharts than even the best of traditional marketing campaigns.\n<h2>If you have a picture of the US President using your product, tell the world about it</h2>\nIn 2009, the US national CIO unveiled the Federal IT Dashboard which was designed to give the public a look at the status of thousands of ongoing IT projects in the government. It also tracked the effectiveness of the government's overall IT spending — 600 billion dollars of them. The dashboard was using FusionCharts in plenty, something even Tim O'Reilly made a mention of in an article he wrote. That was a great story to go tell the world about, but it got even better. One of these nights, while idly browsing the web in the middle of the night, we came across a picture of Barack Obama using the Federal IT Dashboard. While we could have told the world how Barack Obama was using FusionCharts as a part of the Federal IT Dashboard, we decided to be bold and shortened it down to Barack Obama uses FusionCharts. And then we went to the mass media with the story. We were covered in many of the leading publications in the country. In fact till today, every coverage on FusionCharts makes a mention of Obama using FusionCharts in one way or the other. After all, how many companies can claim that White House uses their product with a picture to prove it?\n<h2>Give people more reasons to remember you than just the product</h2>\nBusiness isn't just about your product and offering. A large part of it is how people feel about you. A genuine conversation, a good story, they all add up. Every time we have gone to a tradeshow, we make a list of objectives which includes generating sales leads and getting press coverage. But another of those objectives, and a very important one, is to radiate warmth and happiness to every around. Even to people we spend only a minute with. And it reaps rich rewards when we come back to emails from people saying how much they enjoyed meeting us. There have been times when people have commented on a FusionCharts article somewhere on the web just to say that the team is very friendly. Words like those can brighten up even the toughest of days. And then of course, there's the power of a good story. People love stories, no matter how left-brained they are. So when FusionCharts completed a decade of being in business, we decided to write an eBook on the complete journey of the company, with warts and all. And the feedback we have got within a week of launching the book has been touching, to say the least. People who did business with us half a decade ago are writing in just reminiscing about the good old times. Entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs are writing in about how inspiring they found the story. Existing users and customers are writing in to say how they feel like a part of FusionCharts now. There's nothing like a good story.\n<h2>Final words</h2>\n<p>A startup founded by a 17-year old in a country without a product ecosystem as such can never be smooth-sailing. But what it can be is extremely satisfying, as you tackle problems both usual and unusual. And extremely satisfying it has been.

It used to be that early stage venture folks just did early stage investing, late stage venture folks just did late stage investing, and public equity investors only invested in publicly traded stocks.&nbsp; What surprised me is that now, it seems like everybody invests in late stage private companies.<img id=\"img-1352147788293\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/hubspot-funding.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"describe the image\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>This is certainly not the “official” way to look at it, but here’s the way I ended up bucketing types of investors in my own head.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Typical Early Stage VC Firms with Growth Equity Funds</b> – These are folks like Sequoia, Accel, General Catalyst, Redpoint, DFJ, etc.,&nbsp; that have typically started new funds with new teams focused only on investing in late stage companies.&nbsp; They write checks from $15 million to $100 million as far as I can tell, and I think they’re pretty valuation sensitive as a group. They usually want to take a board seat and can add a lot of value in terms of knowledge, connections, and pedigree -- Sequoia led HubSpot’s last round and has been huge on those fronts.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Late Stage VC Funds</b> – Think Meritech, Adams Street, August, Norwest, Tenaya, Questmark, SAP, and DAG. These folks only do late stage equity and write checks from $10 million to $40 million as far as I can tell. I think they are less valuation sensitive than the traditionally early stage folks. They are typically a bit more arms length in their level of involvement which often translates into a board observer seat -- they seem to follow-on the top tier early stage folks and rely on them for their advice and connections.</li>\n<li><b>Big Check Late Stage Funds</b> – GA, TCV, NEA, etc. seem to only do late stage equity and write checks north of $40 million. I think they are relatively valuation sensitive, but keep in mind I only have a small sample size here. It seems they’ll want a board seat and to be very involved – and they can add a lot of value.</li>\n<li><b>Private Equity Funds</b> – TA, Summit, etc.&nbsp; are the types of firms I know the least about, but my sense is that these folks do late stage investing and write “biggish” checks. They seem to be wired to buy out existing investors, put in some working capital, and raise debt. This can be a great approach for a company, but it’s probably hard to work for a firm that already has a lot of venture money in it. My sense is that they want to be involved and are value-add.</li>\n<li><b>Public Funds</b> – The last bucket is folks like Fidelity, T Rowe, Janus, Cross Creek/Wasatch, Altimeter, Tiger, and Morgan Stanley. They invest out of public equity funds, seem to write checks from $10 million on up, and tend to be slightly less valuation sensitive (we’ll talk about why below). They are financial investors and do not want to be overly involved, which means no board seats or observer seats for the most part.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s my sense of things based on insights from HubSpot’s mezzanine round of funding. If I’ve missed some funds, please do include them in the comments section so we can make this article as useful as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Surprising Value Of Public Investors Investing In Your Private Company</span></b></p>\n<p>We went with public funds -- #5 above -- not private funds for three main reasons that made a lot of sense for us, though they might not make sense for your company:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Public investors tend to buy more of your shares after you go public, while private investors will typically look to sell their shares after you go public.&nbsp; The venture funds incentive system is set up such that they are supposed to sell the shares and distribute the profits to their investors after a reasonable time elapses following the IPO. My sense is that the period of time between when you go public and when they sell varies widely, and the better the firm’s footing the more likely it is they will hold. Having said that, I think it’s pretty rare that the traditional venture folks actually buy more in the public markets. &nbsp;It’s important to note that this does not matter if your most likely outcome is a trade sale.</li>\n<li>Public investors can “recycle” their capital while most venture funds can’t really do that easily. Huh? If Fidelity gets a 70% return on their investment in your company in a year and a half, they are pretty happy -- they can turn around and reinvest that money into other stocks. If Accel gets a 70% return on their investment in a year and a half, they are actually pretty unhappy -- they need to return that 70% to their investors and can’t really reinvest it. In order for venture funds to make their math work, they need to get a 3X return on their investment. So what? Well, this means that the late stage venture folks will likely give you lower valuations and more “structure” (i.e. participation) in their deals to try to reach higher return levels, while the public folks will likely be more flexible.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We are generally very happy with our board and were not looking for new members or even new observers.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, that’s HubSpot. Every company is different. Let’s just say, as an example, that you are a travel technology company that’s doing well, but you need some help on the board, some VC pedigree and connections to improve your team, domain expertise, and maybe some money to buy out existing investors and their board seats. In that case, you’d be nuts not to go with, for example, General Catalyst or Sequoia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Surprisingly Common Use of “Structure”</span></b></p>\n<p>In our A through D rounds, the concept of “structure” did not come up. In fact, when one of the potential Series E investors asked me, “Are you open to ‘structure’?” it caught me off guard, because I didn’t know what it was and didn’t want to seem like a complete rookie. So I said, “Let me check with my board and get back with you.”&nbsp; That turned out to be a good answer, by the way.</p>\n<p>Structure is a fancy word for preferential terms set up to increase the return of the new investor, or limit the downside of the new investor. As I mentioned earlier, private investors typically need to get a 3X return on a late stage deal, and they’re nervous that they will invest money into a company and six months later it will sell for 75% more than they invested. For someone who can reinvest that capital, that’s a great outcome; for a VC, it’s not. In order to protect themselves from that risk, they will ask for participating preferred stock that, for instance, will put a floor on their return of 2X. Given the VC’s incentives, it makes perfect sense, but that is a different type of equity that sits on top of everyone else’s equity that needs to be looked at extremely carefully. It comes in a lot of flavors and can work well to bridge a valuation gap, but can be confusing, so I recommend folks dig in and build the model on how it ripples through.</p>\n<p>Another type of structure that VCs put in is a block on an IPO or trade sale of less than 2X (or something like that). This block makes perfect sense for the VC given their contract structures with their LPs, and it might make sense for you -- but you need to go into that with eyes wide open.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Surprising Importance of Your Series A Terms on Your Mezzanine Round</span></b></p>\n<p>It turns out that the terms from your Series A are most often cut and pasted into your later round deals. When you compromise on terms in the early stages, you will have to pay the price in the later stages. You generally don’t start from scratch and rehash the terms.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Surprisingly Rational Pricing</span></b></p>\n<p>The initial pricing interest in our early stage rounds varied widely; but in our mezzanine round, the numbers came in much closer to each other. There are hard public numbers to look at with publicly traded companies and recent acquisitions by public companies. The pricing discussions just seemed much more “real” than the earlier stage deals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My advice here would be to get your arms around the public companies for your industry, and where those companies were when they were your size. We built a chart that showed every public SaaS company and what their revenues and growth trajectories were from their early days to where they are today. It was a useful tool in our discussions, particularly when we were getting compared to public companies that were growing at 25% and we were growing at 85%.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Surprising Value of Currency Valuation in M&amp;A</span></b></p>\n<p>Private companies buying private companies with stock is a tricky business. After our Series D, we acquired another privately traded company called Performable with a combination of cash and stock. The trickiest part of deals like this is figuring out what their stock is worth, and what your stock is worth. The nice part about just having finished a relatively late stage, clean round is that at least our side had a real number to negotiate from. If neither side has a recent number, those negotiations are really tough to sort out.</p>\n<p>Those are some of the surprising things we learned in our recent mezzanine round.

Nicholas is the co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.themediagraph.com\" title=\"MediaGraph\" target=\"_self\">MediaGraph</a>, a public relations platform that enables small businesses to manage their own media outreach. He was formerly a journalist and an Accenture management consultant.</em><br><br>In my previous career as a journalist, I received hundreds of story pitches with press releases attached every day. Like so many other well-meaning journos, I'd make a valiant attempt to at least skim the first two lines of every one in a vain attempt to maintain some sort of equilibrium between the read and the unread.<img id=\"img-1351606562283\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/press-hat.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"press hat\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"><br><br>In those two lines, I (and almost all the journalists I know) made a rapid judgement on the newsworthiness of content, never spending enough time thinking about what a story could become, rather than what it was. In short, if your piece of news wasn’t 100 percent right, it would rarely get the time of day.<br><br>Savvy PR practitioners know this. The best will be in contact all the time (or at least well before they have a news story to pitch) in an attempt to figure out how to maximize the chances of something being picked up. It’s a wonder there aren’t more of them. Sadly there aren’t and 80 - 90 percent of pitches I received followed the tired format of \"Hi X, Company Y is launching a product next week and we thought it would be of interest to publication Z.\"<br><br>So here's an idea to try when getting media coverage for your startup - don't start by pitching the product. Start by pitching nothing.<br><br>Clearly showing that you understand that a journalist doesn't just exist to publicize you is one of the fastest routes to his or her heart. It’s literally the difference between drunkenly hitting on someone in a club and taking him/her on multiple dates to the restaurant you can’t afford. Hell, you'd be unlikely to start a sales pitch without knowing your customer, or begin discussions with an investor without finding out exactly what they were interested in -- so why treat the media differently?<br><br>The closest relationships journalists build are with people who can provide long-term value to them by offering something that isn't just self-promotion. Conversely, these tend to be the names you see cropping up again and again in the media.<br><br>So instead of a product pitch, why not offer something else if you’re trying to use the media to get the word out about your startup? The following list should get you started:<br>\n<h2><span>Comment</span></h2>\nHaving a network of people to offer opinion and analysis is critical for most journalists and it's a great way of getting your name out there, even when you don't have any news. So make sure your media contacts know who you are and what you're qualified to talk about by introducing yourself with a short biography and an offer to help.<br>\n<h2><span>Briefing</span></h2>\nMost journalism is about distilling complex topics into chunks that people understand, which means journalists need to be knowledgable about a lot, and always stay up-to-date. If you're an expert, or have access to experts, you can offer to spend some time highlighting trends or recent developments in your area to help journalists do their job better.<br>\n<h2><span>Access</span></h2>\nPerhaps it's a cliche, but one of the best ways to curry favor is to open doors. Does your business have an investor, a board member or a founder who's in demand? Offering an introduction to the right person can help ensure that you're remembered for the right reasons, and it doesn’t have to be just a cynical gesture. Connect two people who will benefit from knowing each other and you’ve done them both a good turn.<br>\n<h2><span>Data</span></h2>\nMany companies I've come across sit on piles of newsworthy data they've never considered using. It could be information interesting to everybody or just to a niche audience, but take a look at <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/PressCenter-i4563-c1-Press_Releases.html\" title=\"some\" target=\"_self\">some</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/10/comScore_Reports_August_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share\" title=\"other\" target=\"_self\">other</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www2.dupont.com/Media_Center/en_US/daily_news/november/article20111118c.html\" title=\"examples\" target=\"_self\">examples</a> of companies doing this and see if you might do something similar. Are you collecting data you can aggregate about your users that will be of interest to a consumer publication, such as their top tracks, movies or TV shows? Do you have access to collated information on Twitter that a journalist could use to prove a point? Or does your business measure something nobody else does? <br>\n<h2><span>Insights into the business</span></h2>\nTechCrunch ran a surprisingly popular series (<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/tc-cribs/\"><span>http://techcrunch.com/tag/tc-cribs/</span></a>) some years back which took a look around startup offices in the style of MTV Cribs -- a perhaps extreme example of how day-to-day business operations can be interesting. Think about whether your organization does anything particularly noteworthy operationally which could give a journalist some inspiration. Are there unique management styles or internal practices?<br>\n<h2><span>Coffee</span></h2>\nToo simple? Never! If you can meet conveniently, meeting a journalist face to face is the best way to make sure that you'll be remembered as more than just an email address. It also signals that you’re willing to invest serious time on getting to know this person, which will be appreciated - and who knows where you’ll both end up in the future?<br><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/91423/The-Classy-Way-To-Get-Media-Coverage-For-Your-Startup.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=2pSek93NINg:0ET_R-KKut4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/2pSek93NINg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/2pSek93NINg/The-Classy-Way-To-Get-Media-Coverage-For-Your-Startup.aspx", :published_at => Tue, 30 Oct 2012 14:31:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:91423", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

It was embarrassing to have to tell people on a somewhat regular basis that I didn't really know what I was doing. So how do I feel about that?' One day I'm plagued by self doubt and the next I'm feeling more confident because I figured something out. The excitement of a potentially lucrative new venture was tempered by the anxiety of self doubt and fear of the unknown. A destructive cycle of confidence and self doubt can develop as a result, and can wear out even the most resilient of people if not recognized so the pattern can change.<img id=\"img-1351105522820\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/mirror-illusion.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"mirror illusion\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>To help me climb out of this spin cycle is being able to identify and own my experience. Knowing what I'm feeling and how it influences my behavior or decision making is key to managing this dichotomy. This (internal) awareness helps reduce the chances of letting these unpleasant feelings translate into actions that require more energy and time to correct. If I know what I'm feeling and why, I can differentiate between what is my stuff and what is an organizational matter.</p>\n<p><strong>“I think I deserve more shares”: </strong>Let's use conflict with a co-founder as an example. The idea of a partner wanting to renegotiate their terms can be a major pitfall that sinks a startup, according to Noam Wasserman (<a href=\"http://dharme.sh/osfoundersdilemmas\">The Founder's Dilemmas</a>). This dilemma is common because we don't know well enough the contributions of each partner early in the project, and roles often change throughout the process. When a partner believes they are contributing more and their worth has increased, they may naturally want more equity and recognition.</p>\n<p>Our initial response may be rigidity. Tensing up and digging in our heels, justifying our defensiveness as our partner's misdirected priorities. How dare they focus on greed as opposed to the company? Aren't they a team player? Why are they willing to sabotage everything we have been working toward? Then we ask ourselves the question, why does this feel like a betrayal? What's being evoked may be a loss of control or a feeling of fear that we are losing our grip on the company. Perhaps we lose trust in our partner, conjuring up all the times we have been let down by somebody in the past.</p>\n<p>A startup is like a newly hatched chick, small and vulnerable to prey. Why can't I protect and control this entity I've worked so hard to create? After all, nobody was there at 3:00 am when I came up with the idea. (If they were, they probably could have shamed me out of that celebratory bowl of chocolate ice cream).</p>\n<p>Paying attention to our experience will help us in a few different ways. We will have greater empathy towards our partner, allowing them to feel heard. Once your partner feels understood, they aren't going to put on a full court press to back you into a corner. Paying attention to our experience also allows us to separate past issues versus current ones. I'm aware that my partner is just nervous about all the extra work they are doing and they aren't like my ex-girlfriend who slept with my best friend in high school.</p>\n<p><strong>Expanding our self awareness helps with everyday interactions — not just the high intensity ones</strong>. Take a situation in which your programmers aren't following through on tasks with the alacrity they did when excitement in the project was higher. Aggravation can easily set in and snippiness can follow. We get on their case, which in turn causes resentment on their part and even slower responsiveness. Or, we can utilize our growing awareness and realize that we are being driven by fear.</p>\n<p>In this scenario we add on a new level of awareness, which is external. Now instead of looking inward we are scanning our environment to pick up clues on what may be happening with others or even systems. In the example given above, our programmers may be feeling disconnected from the organization. They don't see all the effort going into marketing or how the sales team is getting positive feedback from the clients. All they hear is what isn't working and how they need to work faster. Their initial excitement has diminished and their frustration level is growing, hence their slowing response time. So getting on their case may work temporarily but in the long run it can create more chronic indifference.</p>\n<p>Now that we have scanned our environment and determined that they are feeling detached and discouraged. We integrate this new information with our own heightened awareness and devise a more intentional response which serves both sides better.</p>\n<p>Awareness is more complex then we realize it to be. It involves scanning both our internal and external environments to determine the impact we are having on others and others are having on us. Most situations that can be handled in a way that promotes cohesiveness on our teams can turn into disasters if we aren't using our awareness. <strong>A startup CEO with a high level of awareness will influence their organization in profound ways</strong>, most importantly helping the startup to become adaptive.</p>\n<p>An adaptive organization as described by Eric Ries (<a href=\"http://dharme.sh/LDOGCb\">The Lean Startup</a>), is one in which the team uses data to learn and grow. Ries bases his concept on a validated learning approach that allows a company to measure their efforts and then pivot accordingly. What is also important in addition to learning from how our product is responded to, are the processes which exist among our team. Awareness is the key to understanding our own responses, the behaviors of our team, and the way in which different parts of the organization work together to form a whole.</p>\n<p>Startups that don't prioritize adaptation are more prone to making mistakes and repeating these mistakes which can easily become maladaptive patterns. Getting excited after days of self-doubt and then making impulsive decisions without enough information is just the type of pattern that can be prevented with greater awareness. Adaptation is the direct result of scanning our environment and making changes based on the information obtained in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few obstacles to improving one's awareness. The first is a CEO who is highly intelligent. Sound strange? Intelligent people tend to over-think and analyze. <strong>Awareness isn't about figuring things out with your mind</strong>; it's about using your body or more specifically your senses. Ask yourself what you feel in your gut, where you are holding tension, or what memories are being evoked.</p>\n<p>Another obstacle is our resistance to giving up control. My startup is a product of a great idea, a tremendous amount of hard work and sacrifice, and we aren't about to see it decimated by apathy or greed. Remember that others may not feel the same passion as you do but they can be helped to take greater ownership if they know their feelings are valued. Taking time to scan others experience and verbalize what you imagine them to be feeling will go a long way toward building loyalty.</p>\n<p>So take a moment and step back before reacting to people or situations. Ask yourself what is going on inside you to trigger your feelings. Consider what is driving the actions or inactions of others around you. Scan the team to see how people are working together and what the underlying causes are for problems.

It has been a great week and thus, I was inspired to share my experience at the conference, Business of Software, or BoS for short. The conference website is <a href=\"http://businessofsoftware.org/\">businessofsoftware.org</a> and the hash tag was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/?q=%23BoS2012\">#BoS2012</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://askctsblogsstore.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Images/Business%20of%20Software.png\" alt=\"Business of Software logo\" width=\"251\" height=\"200\"></p>\n<p>This was the second time I have attended the BoS conference and the first time it has been hosted at the <a href=\"http://www.intercontinentalboston.com/\">Intercontinental Hotel</a> in Boston, MA. My first visit was in 2010, when it was hosted at the Seaport Hotel and World Trade Center in Boston, where I came away inspired in a different way. This first visit really kicked off my interest for reading business oriented books which began with one of the books provided to conference attendees, Youngme Moon's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746086X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030746086X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd</em></a>. I quickly plowed through this book on my way to picking up Seth Godin's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591844096/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591844096&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>Linchpin: Are You Indispendable</em></a> for the plane ride home. Both Youngme and Seth were speakers at the 2010 conference, among many other outstanding speakers such as Eric Ries (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307887898&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>The Lean Startup</em></a>) and Scott Farquhar (<a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/company\">Atlassian</a>).</p>\n<p>When the time came for the 2011 conference, my wife and I were expecting our second child and the due date aligned with the conference. One of these things I simply could not miss. Fortunately, 2011 marked the first year that the conference was to be streamed live online. I was not able to listen in to the entire conference, but I was able to experience a few of the, once again great, speakers. Primary among them, Clayton Christensen gave an outstanding presentation that made me instantly grab a copy of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060244/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062060244&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>The Innovators Dilemma</em> </a>. Other great speakers in 2011 included Alex Osterwalder (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876417/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470876417&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>Business Model Generation</em></a>) and Alexis Ohanian (<a href=\"http://alexisohanian.com/\">Making the World Suck Less</a>).</p>\n<p>Early in 2012, when the conference dates were announced, I jumped at the opportunity and registered right away, even before the speakers had been announced. With what I had seen over the past two years, I had full confidence that the 2012 lineup would be top notch. As the year went on, I continued to be impressed with the lineup that was coming together and chief among that list for me was Dan Pink. I had previously read Dan Pink's book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594484805&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>Drive</em></a> and seen his brief Ted presentation on the topic, so I knew he would be one to look forward to. Other names that piqued my interest included Kathy Sierra, Dharmesh Shah, Noam Wasserman, and Bob Dorf. The latter two whose books, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691149135/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=primpant-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0691149135\"><em>The Founders Dilemma</em> </a>and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984999302/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0984999302&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>The Startup Owner’s Manual</em></a> respectively, had been queued on my Amazon wish list for some time. During the conference these two books got dropped off my wish list, not because they failed to impress with their presentations, but because they were both giveaways to conference attendees. Outside of the great speaker lineup, reading my mind with the book selection wasn't the only way the conference impressed me. The excellent food, intriguing workshop, and overall high quality of attendees also greatly enhanced the experience. Overall I was very impressed with the conference and look forward to returning next year.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this post will summarize my thoughts in each of the presentations at this year's conference. Unfortunately if you weren’t in attendance, these summaries simply won’t do the presentations justice as there were so many stories and anecdotes to go along with them that provided much context and value as well. Thus, I would highly recommend that you follow the BoS conference <a href=\"http://businessofsoftware.org/blog/\">blog</a> as videos will eventually make their way onto the site.</p>\n<h1>Day 1</h1>\n<h2>Kathy Sierra</h2>\n<h3>Building the Minimum Badass User</h3>\n<p>With a title which was clearly a play on the concept of a minimum viable product, as popularized by Eric Ries, Kathy proposed that in order to address the problem many companies face of great product, didn't sell or GP;DS for short, that we should not be focusing on making an awesome product but instead on making awesome, or badass, users.</p>\n<p>Kathy outlined three popular myths when looking to create expert users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expertise comes from more knowledge</li>\n<li>Expertise comes from more experience</li>\n<li>Expertise requires natural talent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On your way to building badass users and debunking these myths, Kathy identified three things that you need: models, edge practice, and forward flow. As the first speaker of the event, she foreshadowed the last when she referenced Dan Pink's as \"the best summary of determination theory.\" She wrapped up by providing the following guidance for each of the three identified needs for building badass users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Models: provide high-quality, high-quantity examples of badass</li>\n<li>Edge Practice: provide exercises designed to build precise, measurable, fine-grained skills in 1-3 sessions</li>\n<li>Forward Flow: provide motivation to keep users making forward progress</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Jason Cohen (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/asmartbear\">@asmartbear</a>)</h2>\n<h3>How data, statistics, and “the numbers” will make you totally do the wrong thing</h3>\n<p>Jason’s presentation was interesting warning to consider with the rise A/B testing popularity and the measure everything philosophy. Although, none of this should be news as Jason addressed this on his blog in 2009 and he was even kind enough to create a friendly URL to share the math: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/abhamster\">bit.ly/abhamster</a></p>\n<p>Jason proposed that instead of blindly testing headlines and other tweaks that you instead identify a theory and focus on testing that theory. Thus, your strategy should not necessarily be to measure everything but instead to pick 1-2 key metrics to optimize, a few thresholds to watch, utilize simple sensitivity analysis, and most importantly, fold real data back into the model.</p>\n<h2>Joel Spolsky (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/spolsky\">@spolsky</a>)</h2>\n<h3>The cultural anthropology of Stack Exchange</h3>\n<p>We all know Joel from his popular blog, Joel on Software, his company, Fog Creek, and as the CEO of Stack Overflow. If you aren’t already familiar with Stack Overflow and other websites in the <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/\">Stack Exchange</a> network, then you likely would have been lost in Joel’s presentation as he focused on the structure and how the community functions. In short, the communities that thrive around the Stack Exchange model are best described as, in my words not Joel’s, passionate and nerdy. Take a look at some of the more popular, outside of Stack Overflow of course, Stack Exchange based communities: <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/\">Math</a>, <a href=\"http://paleohacks.com/\">Paleo</a>, <a href=\"http://gaming.stackexchange.com/\">Gaming</a>, and the <a href=\"http://english.stackexchange.com/\">English Language</a> (if you found this from here, please excuse my inadequacies).</p>\n<h2>Dharmesh Shah (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>)</h2>\n<h3>Lessons from the trenches</h3>\n<p>Dharmesh is a BoS regular and always delivers a great presentation. I think this year’s most tweeted quote award goes to Dharmesh for the insight that “before you gamify your product, you should decrapify it.” The reminder of his presentation will filled with so many other great insights that instead of spend the rest of the article writing about those, I will wrap up into a few key highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no better time, since the early 1990’s, to build a software business</li>\n<li>You don’t just want customers, you want crazy loyal fans.</li>\n<li>The technical switching costs of you software should be low but the emotional switching costs should be high.</li>\n<li>You should pick markets where the barrier to exit is low.</li>\n<li>You should strive not just to build a great startup, but to build great entrepreneurs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Peter Bauer</h2>\n<h3>Founding principles versus scaling principles</h3>\n<p>Peter discussed his experiences from founding and scaling <a href=\"http://www.mimecast.com/\">Mimecast</a> from 2003 to now and addressed four principle items that he learned along the way: building something with friends, deal constructively with my fears about success, never allow an investor that would change chemistry, and have clear intent and logistics. The first three allowed Peter to provide some insight into his specific experience going from the incubation to growth of Mimecast while the fourth principle provided the actionable items for audience takeaway. Peter argued that “intent creates a power multiplier,” or in other words, if you are intentional about the goals and directions of your business, the power or drive towards those goals will be even more powerful. The most powerful part of Peter’s presentation was, at least for me, the message that all too often it is the accounting (or revenue) measures that shape the intent of a business, thereby causing the business to lose its grip on its vision. Hence, we must ensure the clear intent and logistics to avoid straying down this path.</p>\n<h2>Noah Kagan (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/noahkagan\">@noahkagan</a>)</h2>\n<h3>Lovegasms</h3>\n<p>Noah made a last minute change in his presentation topic, originally slated to be <em>Rogue Marketing Strategies</em>, in order to cover something that was more relevant and timely to his passion. Noah shared a chart of AppSumo’s revenue that showed a clear decline beginning around the October 2011 timeframe and was very open about the lack of passion and customer focused that had resulted from his disconnection thus, the topic change. The reason for the loss of passion and the decline was summed up in short as: get rich, get boring and risk adverse. Hence, the AppSumo Framework for decision making was born:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is this X something we’re <strong>Proud</strong> of?</li>\n<li>Is it simple?</li>\n<li>Are we having fun?</li>\n<li>Is it profitable?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to this framework, AppSumo developed <a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/happy/\">Project Happiness</a> to track what their customers were saying. At time of writing, this happiness index is hovering slightly about the middle in the “ok” category and well below the “Amazing” category. As part of the project, AppSumo is looking to six steps evaluate the business on and hopefully get their customer happiness score into the “Amazing” category.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Core Values aka The HELL YES/NO</li>\n<li>Value</li>\n<li>Authenticity</li>\n<li>Surprise</li>\n<li>Consistent</li>\n<li>Personal</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Day 2</h1>\n<h2>Peldi (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peldi\">@peldi) </a></h2>\n<h3>Coding is the easiest part</h3>\n<p>On the morning of day two, I rode the elevator down with Peldi and another conference attendee, where Peldi shared with us that he was a bit nervous. If you’ve ever seen Peldi present or talked with him, you would certainly find this humorous as you would never guess that he is the nervous type. Despite his stated nervousness, he delivered a great presentation with a focus on six key areas, aside from coding, that are crucial to the success of your business: vision, product (or service), marketing, company, support, and ecosystem. Throughout his review of these areas, Peldi shared insights that he gained from Balsamiq in each of these areas. The following were some of my key takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Embrace your ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Surround yourself with excellence. Peldi even said that he always wants to be the dumbest person in the room. If this ever happens, I would really like to meet the people in that room.</li>\n<li>Laws are like features, easy to add, but really hard to remove.</li>\n<li>Don’t put in place unnecessary policies, the main goal of a policy should be to keep everyone on the same page. If/when a policy is needed, you should explain why it is needed. Balsamiq’s vacation policy is: take some.</li>\n<li>Pace &gt; Deadlines, everyone works at a different pace and if you can find and embrace that pace, they will be more productive than simply setting a deadline.</li>\n<li>Remove salary from the equation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Mikey Trafton (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeytrafton\">@mikeytrafton) </a></h2>\n<h3>How to build a world class culture in three easy steps</h3>\n<p>Mikey is a long time BoS attendee whose first time presenting was a runaway success. If you haven’t heard of Mikey before, he is the Founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.bluefishgroup.com/\">Blue Fish Development Group</a> and <a href=\"http://fireantsoftware.com/\">Fire Ant Software</a>, both services companies that sell to “big freaking companies.” Mikey’s presentation was all about the importance of building a great culture to the success of a company, summarized in three steps as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide what you care about.</li>\n<li>Hire people that care about the same things you do.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to the things you care about.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While these steps may seem obvious, Mikey was able to share many lessons learned in each of these areas that really sold the importance understanding these three steps. When growing Blue Fish, Mikey made the decision that above all else, Blue Fish stood for “client elation,” and in order to achieve client elation, he wrote down these five core values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Client focus, take the clients goals and make them our own.</li>\n<li>Teamwork, build and elite team rather than a team of elites.</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Excellence</li>\n<li>Communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mikey stressed that writing down these core values made it concrete and tangible and really allowed him to hone in on identifying people who were the right cultural fit. However, just finding the right people doesn’t end your effort to build a great culture as you must constantly be paying attention to the three steps because “you will get the behaviors that you tolerate” and you must ensure that you are always focused on what you care about.</p>\n<h2>Adii Pienaar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/adii\">@adii) </a></h2>\n<h3>Going global form the edge of the world</h3>\n<p>Adii is one of the founders behind <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/\">Woothemes</a>. Woothemes is headquartered in Cape Town, South Africa, not exactly a city known as a great place to build a startup. Adii’s presentation likely hit home to many entrepreneurs in the room as he used his story to focus on the unimportance of where you are building your startup. My key takeaways from Adii’s presentation were as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invest in branding because it’s free. Your culture and how you portray yourself is the brand.</li>\n<li>Customer service is cheap marketing.</li>\n<li>When trying to identify your business model, find something that enables others to make money because that will be recession proof.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dan Lyons (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdanlyons\">@realdanlyons) </a></h2>\n<h3>What would Steve do? The insider’s guide to talking to the media.</h3>\n<p>Dan Lyons was a senior editor at Forbes is now a writer at Newsweek and is the guy behind “Fake Steve Jobs.” I’ll have to apologize to my readers that I didn’t take very good notes during Dan’s presentation because he was so entertaining I had a hard time keeping up, this was truly one where you had to be there. However, I did manage to jot down the primary takeaway from Dan, which loosely paraphrased is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>If you are basing your business on anything other than mobile, you should stop now.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Gail Goodman (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gail_Goodman\">@Gail_Goodman) </a></h2>\n<h3>When software and people mix</h3>\n<p>In 2010, Constant Contact was ranked 134<sup>th</sup> in Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500, however not that long ago, they too were a startup struggling to find their business model. Gail told the story of Constant Contact’s growth over the “long slow ramp of death” from 2002 – 2005 as they were “only eating what they were killing.” There are no silver bullets, she said, but there are many little things. First and foremost, you should start with the view from the customer’s perspective, not by looking at your metrics. Optimizing the sales funnel is anything but low touch Gail argued, it requires a combination of technology and people you have to iterate in “measure – test – repeat” cycle until you get it to work. Finally, Gail wrapped revealing that word of mouth has been the single best channel for Constant Contact and that the best gas pedal they have found for word of mouth is a great customer experience.</p>\n<h2>Paul Kenny (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulKennyOL\">@PaulKennyOL) </a></h2>\n<h3>Resistance is futile!</h3>\n<p>Day two wrapped up with another BoS conference regular, this time everyone’s favorite sales guy. Paul opened up with a list of things that good sales people do really well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand “value”</li>\n<li>Dialogue</li>\n<li>Share stories</li>\n<li>Ask for a commitment</li>\n<li>Manage resistance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remainder of the presentation focused on the last item on this list, managing resistance. Paul argued that many sales cultures take the path of least resistance and that this is largely detrimental to a sales process because “a sales conversation with no resistance rarely ends in a deal being done.” Most customer resistance (or objections) are either logical (i.e. it won’t work for us) or emotional (i.e. I don’t like it) and typically facilitate two traditional responses attack or give up. In effectively dealing with objections, Paul suggested that there are eight things that are required of a sales person, the first four which can be trained, while the later four cannot be trained and you must there for look to hire for. Those either things are: client awareness, market knowledge, product/service knowledge, sales technique, speed of though, staying on side, persistence, and reframing. Whether you are an expert in these eight areas or you just want to pass this along to your sales guy, Paul offered the following general principles for dealing with objection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand and isolate the underlying objection</li>\n<li>Get on side (empathize)</li>\n<li>Respond / Reframe</li>\n<li>Confirm and Close</li>\n<li>Don’t use “why”, it puts people on their back</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Day 3</h1>\n<h2>Noam Wasserman (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/noamwass\">@noamwass) </a></h2>\n<h3>Understanding founder dilemmas</h3>\n<p>Professor Noam Wasserman started out day three by not even taking the stage, instead he constantly wondered the audience delivering a steady stream of insight that was truly engaging. Leading in with a quote from New Venture Labs that “most companies fail,” Noam immediately took the opportunity to deliver some statistics on failure based upon the research for his book, the aforementioned <em>Founder’s Dilemma</em>, where he stated that 35% of failures are based upon product development, functional management, and/or market fit problems while the remainder of failures, 65%, can be attributed to people problems. The research for <em>Founder’s Dilemma</em> encompassed four thousand startups, ten thousand founders, and twenty thousand executives, which by my calculations is at least a few more than you get to interact with in your local startup events.</p>\n<p>Keeping with the theme of people problems, Noam identified the stages at which people are injected into the business which can cause dilemmas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When to found / Core founder</li>\n<li>Building the team / Co-founders</li>\n<li>New-Venture Hiring / Hires</li>\n<li>Beyond the Team / Investors, Partners</li>\n<li>Exit Dilemmas / All of the above</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The remainder of his presentation was filled with some great examples from ZipCar to Ockham illustrating various strategies for addressing these issues and their results. While he delivered more than enough details, the presentation will was just the tip of the iceberg for me as it bumped <em>Founder’s Dilemma</em> up to the top of my reading list.</p>\n<h2>Bob Dorf (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bobdorf\">@bobdorf) </a></h2>\n<h3>Customer Development. The science of acceleration for growth Businesses</h3>\n<p>While Noam started with a quote that “most companies fail,” Bob started by saying that most startups fail to scale. Per Bob, the primary reason they fail is because they assume that their customer’s problem, and the product features needed to address their problems, are known. Bob’s presentation focused on addressing these failures by working through a customer discovery – customer validation – pivot cycle. For those familiar with <em>The Lean Startup</em> principles, Bob’s presentation would be familiar as he advocated that your goal should be to speed the time through this cycle in order to maximize chances of success. Ultimately, you should be working to find passionate “earlyvangelists” (i.e. customers who are desperate for you to solve their problem.)</p>\n<h2>Dan Pink (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanielPink\">@DanielPink) </a></h2>\n<h3>The surprising truth about moving others</h3>\n<p>First, I have to admit that Dan Pink was the speaker that I was most excited to see at BoS. I attribute that interest to my reading of his previous book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594484805&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>Drive</em> </a>. If you haven’t read it, I would encourage you to do so right away. If you are not a reader, then take nineteen minutes and watch Dan’s presentation on <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html\">Ted</a>. Now that I’ve got that out of the way, on to Dan’s presentation.</p>\n<p>Dan began by saying that the upcoming book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594487154/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594487154&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=primpant-20\"><em>To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth about Moving Others</em> </a><em>, </em>upon which this presentation was based is only 96% finished. He would be rushing to wrap up the remaining 4% by his Friday deadline. It was great to see an amazing presenter like Dan deliver such a raw presentation on such fresh material. Further, it was exciting to hear how the idea for the book came about. Neil Davidson, one of the organizers of the conference, started a dialog with Dan regarding applying the principles outlined in <em>Drive</em> to sales people. This idea was intriguing enough to Dan that he embarked on a two year investigation of sales to find the answer. He summed up his two years of investigation into one word: disintermediation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>dis·in·ter·me·di·a·tion </strong>[ dìssintər meedee áysh'n ]</p>\n<p>removal of intermediaries: the elimination of intermediaries such as wholesalers or retailers in business transactions between producers and consumers</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the surface it appears that in a world of Amazon, Expedia, and social networks, sales people are becoming obsolete but the research showed a different answer. The death of the salesman has been misreported, the facts simply do not back it up.</p>\n<p>In the past, the salesman always had the most information, there simply wasn’t a way for the consumer to come to the table with the same or more information. In today’s world, we are moving from this world of information asymmetry to a world of information parity. This information parity forces people to take the high road. Hence, Dan proposed three qualities for “how to be” in this new world of information parity. No longer does ABC = Always be closing, the new ABC’s are:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Attunement - The ability to take another's perspective / understand where people are coming from. It is largely about perspective taking.</li>\n<li>Buoyancy - The capacity to deal with \"an ocean\" of rejection</li>\n<li>Clarity - The ability to cut through the muck and provide clarity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So in this new world, who makes the best sales person? The old adage that extroverts are the best sales people simply did not hold up to the research. The correlation between extroversion and sales is .07, basically zero. The evidence shows that the best sales people are “amibverts.” Ambiverts are those individual who fall somewhere on the spectrum between introvert and extrovert. Dan presented a graph of “sales revenue by levels of extraversion” where the numbers were virtually identical to that of what the general population distribution of introverts to extroverts. Correlate this revelation with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that there are 15 million Americans in sales and Dan’s own research showing that all workers spend an average of 41% of their efforts on “selling” and not only are we all in sales now, we might just be the best salesmen.</p>\n<p>So, since we are all in sales now and we might just be our company’s best sales person, Dan proposed three abilities needed by a successful sales person: pitch, improvise, and serve. What are you doing to improve these areas? I know for one that I will be preordering Dan’s upcoming book.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Did you attend the Business of Software conference this year? &nbsp;Or, watch the livestream? &nbsp;If so, what did you learn? &nbsp;</p><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/90583/Highlights-On-The-Business-of-Software-2012.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=ghFHBn3WRus:tE-GntxRx8o:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/ghFHBn3WRus\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/ghFHBn3WRus/Highlights-On-The-Business-of-Software-2012.aspx", :published_at => Mon, 08 Oct 2012 21:14:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:90583", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

It allows your company to grow faster by casting a wider net, and helps diversify your revenue stream. While global expansion can be an exciting time, it’s a significant undertaking and requires some careful planning and making some hard decisions.</p>\n<p>Today, HubSpot announced its <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33614/Announcing-HubSpot-s-New-European-HQ-in-Dublin-Ireland.aspx\" title=\"European Headquarters launch in Dublin, Ireland\" target=\"_self\">European Headquarters launch in Dublin, Ireland</a>. As part of the HubSpot International team, I wanted to share some of our learnings with you.<img id=\"img-1348670894154\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/globe-hatch.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"globe hatch\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>Here are six important things to consider when expanding a startup internationally:</p>\n<h2>1. Follow your customers and prospects</h2>\n<p>To determine where your biggest global opportunity exists, take a look at your customer base. If 50% of your International customer base is in Europe and only 8% is in Latin America, it makes a lot of sense to choose Europe as your International HQ. Let your domestic team build your Latin American segment up to a point where it’s ready for its own HQ. Make sure you have enough proven revenue in a region before opening up a new branch.</p>\n<p>Also take a look at where the majority of your non-domestic prospects, or leads, live. You may notice that you’re generating the most leads in a country other than your largest international customer base. If this is the case, take conversion rates and cultural factors into consideration. Even though you’re generating a lot of leads in a particular country, can its population afford your products’ price point?</p>\n<p>Finally, as much as we'd like to \"follow the metrics\" and make purely data-driven decisions, the choice of location might come down to people. &nbsp;Does one of the founders have a particular affinity or background in a location? &nbsp;Do you already have one of your stars anxious and eager to start an office in a particular country? &nbsp;These \"people-based\" factors should be considered. &nbsp;Often, the \"optimal\" decision from a metrics and revenue perspective is not the \"best\" decision.</p>\n<h2>2. Set ambitious international goals</h2>\n<p>Expanding internationally is a big investment, so it’s important to set ambitious goals to get the highest ROI possible. For example, plan for 30% of your business’ revenue to come from your global HQ within 3-5 years. Defining an international revenue goal for your international office will help you determine things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many sales reps do you need to generate $X in revenue?</li>\n<li>How many marketing leads do you need to generate to make those reps successful?</li>\n<li>How quickly does your international customer segment need to grow to reach that goal within 3 years?</li>\n<li>How many customer service reps will you need in order to serve this segment?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever numbers you set to suit the needs of your own business, make sure you set those goals ahead of time so that you can plan accordingly every step of the way. Setting clear goals ahead of time will help keep the team that opens up the international headquarters accountable for its success.</p>\n<h2>3. Hire locally but be consistent culturally</h2>\n<p>A major benefit of opening up an office overseas is being able to recruit local talent, who will be experts in your industry in their culture. No matter how much you’ve been educated in the nuances of the culture you’re entering into, nobody will be better prepared than the people who grew up in the region.</p>\n<p>If budget allows, try to bring over your new global employees for a couple weeks of training in your primary office. They will likely be teleconferencing frequently with your primary HQ, so having them join for training in-person helps put a face to the name for all future interactions.</p>\n<p>Even though you should plan to hire mainly locals to staff your International Headquarters, be sure to maintain your company culture by sending over a group of expats, even if for a limited time range -- six to 12 months can suffice.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, ensure that from Day 1, members of your international team <em>feel</em>&nbsp;like they're part of the company. &nbsp;Give them training. &nbsp;Give them career opportunities. &nbsp;Give them access to information and resources. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. Network and attend conferences</h2>\n<p>Although America is becoming very dependent on virtual communication, in-person interaction is highly valued in cultures like Europe and East Asia. Use conferences and networking events to make connections with local industry-leaders in the region you’re opening your new office. Plan to stay a couple extra days after the conference for 1:1 meetings with your new connections. Meet with local press in-person to provide interviews on your global expansion plans.</p>\n<p>Networking with the locals will help you spread the word not only about your product, but about the career opportunities now available to the local marketplace. You may need to hire aggressively your first couple years in your new office branch, so networking is imperative to drive high-quality candidates to your business.</p>\n<h2>5. Don’t underestimate cultural differences</h2>\n<p>Just as marketing best practices vary culture-to-culture, so do business practices. For example, in the U.S. it is typical for employees to have 10 non-holiday vacation days. However in Europe, it is customary for employees to have at least 20 non-holiday vacation days -- and be required to take all of them. It’s important to take this cultural difference into account when projecting sales quotas and development sprints.</p>\n<h2>6. Get support from finance, HR, and ops experts</h2>\n<p>When opening an office abroad, there are a lot of overhead elements to plan for, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Negotiating leases and contracts</li>\n<li>Determining company structure</li>\n<li>Setting up accounting and tax reporting systems</li>\n<li>Supporting expat and local employees’ HR needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Expect that you will need ongoing support from your finance, HR, and operations departments, and plan to hire agencies to help if you don’t have the resources in-house. Again, global expansion is a big investment, and it’s important to get these basic elements right from the get-go.</p><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/89570/Hatching-An-International-Office-6-Tips-For-Startups-Going-Global.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=5nnb0MUti9Q:UY5CLWYl2as:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/5nnb0MUti9Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/5nnb0MUti9Q/Hatching-An-International-Office-6-Tips-For-Startups-Going-Global.aspx", :published_at => Wed, 26 Sep 2012 14:37:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:89570", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

Pages trap teachings, and sometimes files trap pages. I kept a note that Danny Lewin, co-founder of Akamai Technologies, wrote in March 2001 describing what good leaders do to build successful teams, and why they work. While Danny probably learned these lessons during his tour as a commando in the Israeli special forces, he applied them as co-founder and CTO of Akamai.<img id=\"img-1347314006451\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/daniel-lewin.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"daniel lewin\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>As many people in our industry know, Danny was tragically killed on American Airlines Flight #11. Those of us who were lucky enough to work with him try to remember, and share, what we learned from him. I worked with Danny at Akamai from 1999-2001. On this anniversary of September 11, 2001, I'm remembering the three keys to team leadership that Danny explained.</p>\n<p>1. To inspire trust: Lead by Example</p>\n<p>2. To build trust among teammates: Suffer Together</p>\n<p>3. To restore trust when it weakens: Hold People Accountable and Get Rid of Non-Performers</p>\n<p><b>1. To Inspire Trust: Lead by Example</b></p>\n<p>For a team to function well, its leader must make decisions that each team member must consent to follow. It all hinges on trust, and the leader must earn it.</p>\n<p>People only trust those whom they respect. To earn the respect of her team, a leader must demonstrate the highest level of ability in at least one of the skills asked of the rest of the team. Not in all of them but in at least one e.g., coding, negotiating, selling, or positioning. Any strong player on a team will only feel safe delegating decision-making to someone whose abilities they respect.</p>\n<p>Shared sacrifice also inspires trust. A great leader must identify and then exemplify the behaviors that he needs the team to adopt. If developers often have to stay up to the wee hours to make a deadline, a good leader brings them pizza and mountain dew and then pulls up a chair and switches on a dark machine. If costs are managed closely, the leader will fly in coach and pay for any perks on his own dime. Others will do as he does.</p>\n<p>A great leader also knows that each team member relies on her to provide him with the three things he needs to stay focused and execute well:</p>\n<p><b>Set specific and clear goals like a north star.</b> If there is no clear common goal, there is nothing to achieve. Teams grow frustrated at indirection and disperse.</p>\n<p><b>Make firm and final decisions</b>. Solicit input, but once the leader makes a decision, she must hold to it, and enforce it. This also creates a language within the team that teaches each member to make better, crisper decisions themselves.</p>\n<p><b>Always follow up on work that you delegate. Leaders can create new accountability in others, but should never</b> <b>abandon their own responsibility for the ultimate outcome.</b> The best leaders follow up often and in detail.</p>\n<p>I remember when Danny gave me the goal of creating new technology partnerships with big companies like IBM, Oracle and BEA. He told me “anyhere you need me, I'll be at that meeting.” He told his secretary to make my meetings his priority. (Judging from her expression, and how many other people were lined up for their 10-minute update with him, I had a feeling he juggled a number of simultaneous priorities). The effect: I carried the ball, but I knew he was on the field too. I still have the notebooks from our daily status meetings, which felt like exciting and motivating team huddles, not micro-management.</p>\n<p><b>2. To Build Trust Among Teammates: Suffer Together</b>.</p>\n<p>Having earned the trust of his team, the leader must seed trust among the teammates. People abandon petty rivalries when something threatens them. Great leaders should not try to protect their team from these outside pressures. Instead they should spotlight the common threat and let every member feel it. In business, the threat of real competition, or of feeling how close the line is between of success and failure, is an opportunity to let a team suffer together. Through this they learn to trust each other or perish.</p>\n<p><b>To Restore Trust When it Weakens: Hold People Accountable and Get Rid of Non-Performers</b>.</p>\n<p>Great leaders hold people accountable successfully by honoring an unspoken contract between them. The team members make commitments to each other and to the leader. Then the leader measures each of them fairly and by the same standards - by how well they did what they said they would do. The leader pays each member by how well they performed their part of the deal.</p>\n<p>But when one member fails to execute, other teammates see it immediately. They lose confidence both in the non-performer and in the leader for failing to uphold the deal. To preserve the trust that the leader has inspired by example and spread with shared suffering, the leader must remove the non-performer from the team. This restores trust between the team and the leader because they see the leader honoring the contract between them. They feel reassured that they, and their remaining teammates, must be performing. Then they trust each other to do their jobs and can concentrate on doing their own. (Of course, removing a non-performer only builds trust when the team member has had a fair chance to achieve his commitments, fair notice when performance is sub-par, and a fair chance to improve.)</p>\n<p>Danny knew a lot about leadership, and he brought an unusual combination of skills to Akamai. In his remarkable and tragically short life, he was a commando in the Israeli Special Forces counter-terror group, then a genius mathematics graduate student at MIT, and then a visionary billionaire entrepreneur. He taught us some spectacular lessons about strategy, influence, and leadership. Danny inspired nearly everyone he met to reach farther, and do more.&nbsp;</p><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/89316/Remembering-9-11-Leadership-Lessons-From-Akamai-Founder.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=XhzQix6ZXg4:OtgkXcZYoeM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/XhzQix6ZXg4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/XhzQix6ZXg4/Remembering-9-11-Leadership-Lessons-From-Akamai-Founder.aspx", :published_at => Tue, 11 Sep 2012 14:54:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:89316", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

Kate is a graduate of Stanford Business School and was previously a private equity investor before becoming an entrepreneur.</em></p>\n<p>Despite the scary statistic that women lead just 8% of venture-backed companies, I believe that there has never been a better time to be a young, female entrepreneur. There are an increasing number of great female role models who serve as inspirations.</p>\n<p>Yahoo's decision to hire Marissa Mayer to run the struggling web giant, knowing full well that she was pregnant, is particularly exciting. I had the privilege to hear Mayer talk at a Stanford Women in Management event two years ago and was inspired even then as she talked honestly and openly about everything from her management style to her strategy for achieving the elusive work/life balance.<img id=\"img-1346858291320\" src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/woman-ceo.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"woman ceo\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"></p>\n<p>In all of my experiences speaking with women who run companies, the same four pieces of advice arise time and again:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Connections Count: Build Your Network</strong>\n<p>Early in my career, I received some great advice from a female colleague who told me to find the women I want to emulate and get to know them by asking them out for a cup of coffee. At first, I was a bit nervous to pick up the phone or write the email, because I knew these were busy women. In the past seven years, however, I have reached out at least once a month to female bosses, leaders and entrepreneurs. Only once to date has the recipient not been able to fit me in. I'm often touched at how openly and warmly they share experiences, both professionally and personally. It is through these meetings that I have honed in on my vision for the kind of female leader, mother and wife I hope to someday become.</p>\n<p>Don't forget when you are networking – with men or women – to present yourself confidently. That starts with a strong handshake and good eye contact. Speak confidently about your business or your idea. You want advice and mentorship, but don't forget that you also have experience to offer and share.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Let Others Help: Tap The Resources</strong>\n<p>There are a growing number of resources and organizations dedicated to helping women in technology, many started by female pioneers who had to make their way through unchartered territory just one generation ago. At Stanford, I was a member of the Women in Management club where leaders like Mayer came to speak about their ambitions and tactics for achieving their ideal balance in life. Today, I subscribe to Women 2.0 (<a href=\"http://www.women2.com/\">http://www.women2.com/</a>), a Kauffman-backed organization that offers content, community and conferences for women founders in tech. It's inspiring to keep tabs on other female entrepreneurs, and I've attended several events in San Francisco where I got to connect with other female founders. Springboard Enterprises (<a href=\"http://www.springboardenterprises.org/\">http://www.springboardenterprises.org/</a>) is another useful program that matches female entrepreneurs with coaches, industry contacts and investors. I have coffee every month with different female business owners who openly and warmly share experiences and advice. Check <a href=\"http://meetup.com/\">Meetup</a> and local universities to find other groups of like-minded women near you. These are ideal places for networking, finding mentorship, sourcing investors and generating peer support groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Don't Forego Funding: VCs Are Becoming More Balanced</strong>\n<p>The venture community seems to be turning over a new leaf with the recent wave of successful startups with strong female customer bases. Women make up 60% of Zynga's customers, 77% of Groupon's customers, 82% of Pinterest's users and 70% of all ecommerce buyers. I am a huge online shopper myself and I was able to leverage that authenticity to attract venture backing for my ecommerce startup last August. If your target market is women, you can leverage your experiences and build a better story of how your company will reach other females. Depending on your company you may also be eligible for government grants that are given to organizations run by women.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Learn To Lead: We Need More Movers, Shakers and Mentors</strong>\n<p>Speak with conviction when you are speaking to others and avoid trailing off or framing things like a question. You are an expert in your own area and you should speak about it confidently. Know your weaknesses and build a strong team around you that can support you. Sometimes this means hiring other women – but mostly it means hiring the best person for the job. There were a few female engineers who applied for my company and I was definitely rooting for them, but at the end of the day they weren't all the best candidates. To be a strong leader for my company, I needed to select the best person for the job. Put yourself out there as a mentor for younger women, both in your company and externally. You'll be giving back to the next generation of entrepreneurs while also building your own network.</p>\n<p>WE NEED MORE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS! &nbsp;Please share any other tips or ideas you have in the comments. &nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/89121/4-Pieces-Of-Practical-Advice-for-Women-Entrepreneurs.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=sz31uWmTiCw:01n6B7iF0Ds:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/sz31uWmTiCw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/sz31uWmTiCw/4-Pieces-Of-Practical-Advice-for-Women-Entrepreneurs.aspx", :published_at => Wed, 05 Sep 2012 15:16:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:89121", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

This is good for both the nation and innovation economy. But as any seasoned entrepreneur or investor will tell you, if you have a good idea for a business, it’s very likely that 100 other people have the same or very similar idea. And if you have a great idea perhaps 1,000 people are working on the same idea too. Lower cost office space (coworking, innovation center, etc.), cloud hosted everything, WYSIWYG tools and rapid prototyping applications, easy access to global networks of potential users and customers – well, let’s just say it’s a lot easier and cheaper to get a product concept to market today than it has ever been.<img src=\"http://onstartups.com/Portals/150/images/merger-arrow.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"merger arrow\" class=\"alignRight\" style=\"float: right;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Those same seasoned entrepreneurs and investors will also agree that the key to entrepreneurship is not having the best idea, it’s execution. I have been involved in more than a dozen startups and reviewed plans or advised dozens more. Often times when I see two teams going after a very similar market opportunity I look at the founders and can easily envision a great <em>combined</em> team. One start up has been founded by a marketing professional with ten years experience in a major consumer technology company, another by a tech whiz with a newly minted Masters from MIT, and a third by a born saleswoman who already built a small network of beta testers for her nascent product. But each continue to struggle to reach the critical mass or momentum required to break away from the pack because they are often working alone. Once the CEO hat goes on, it’s hard to take it off, especially willingly. Yet many an entrepreneur would do their fledgling company and their wallet good if they pooled resources with another entrepreneur – money, talent, and especially time – rather than seeing another startup operating in the same space as competitive.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pooling technical resources can deliver a product with a more complete feature-set because of the different perspectives brought to the design and development process by team members with a slightly different but equally valid view point. Pooling capital can mean delivering a more complete product, or if minimal viable product (MVP) is attainable without additional capital then money can be focused on capturing beta testers and/or early users. Pooling talent increases your chances of attracting outside investors and shows with action that all team members are professionals dedicated to making the company successful rather than being CEO of their own startup. And pooling time means that by dividing up critical tasks and responsibilities more gets done faster and with less effort because team members can focus what time they have on doing what they do best.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>If all of the potential merger partners are very early stage, especially if no company has any market traction or revenue, the best approach to a merger is a simple equitable split – 50/50, 25x4, etc. If one person gets greedy, arguing their contribution holds greater value than the rest, then you don’t want them for a partner now or at any stage - championships are rarely won by a single player. If one company has revenue and the other potential partners do not, then some small concession should be made for the entity bringing in the most important resource to continued success.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the best early mergers are teams of professionals who have all seen the same market opportunity and have dedicated this segment of their careers to it. As you sit at your desk in a co-working space or innovation center and engage with other clever people at the coffee shop, consider the notion of joining forces, talk about it openly – you may find a willing partner, a kindred spirit, and greater success than working alone.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>\n<p>Looking for other startup fanatics?&nbsp; Request access to the <a href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\" mce_href=\"http://linkedin.onstartups.com\">OnStartups LinkedIn Group</a>.&nbsp; 130,000+ members and growing daily.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, you should follow me on twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\" rel=\"nofollow\" mce_href=\"http://twitter.com/dharmesh\">@dharmesh</a>. <br></p><p><br></p>\n<img src=\"http://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=150&k=14&bu=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/Default.aspx&r=http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/88366/Connecting-The-Dots-Mergers-Of-Early-Stage-Startups.aspx&bvt=rss\"><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:wF9xT3WuBAs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:wF9xT3WuBAs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feed.onstartups.com/~ff/onstartups?a=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/onstartups?i=L4InGcowWDU:taTb6ZC4PMg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~4/L4InGcowWDU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feed.onstartups.com/~r/onstartups/~3/L4InGcowWDU/Connecting-The-Dots-Mergers-Of-Early-Stage-Startups.aspx", :published_at => Thu, 16 Aug 2012 21:43:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "f1397696-738c-4295-afcd-943feb885714:88366", :feed_title => "Dharmesh Shah", :feed_id => 9)

At a time like this, Leo and I felt it would be wise to take a little time slightly &#8220;off the grid&#8221; and ask ourselves the questions &#8220;where do we want to take this now?&#8221;, &#8220;what do we all want to spend our precious time doing, and how can we ensure we&#8217;re happy and inspired?&#8221; and &#8220;how can we really move the needle as we continue on in 2013?&#8221;. It is a real pleasure that we can even be at a point to consider these questions.\n<br/><br/>\nI am extremely thankful to be able to work with such an amazing group of people, all so aligned with the culture and excited about the product. I crave and enjoy every day working with you all. A lot of what Leo and I will ponder will be just as much to do with culture as to do with product direction, and for me personally this is what makes me jump out of bed every day. I think we have an opportunity here to really push the boundaries in terms of what an outstanding, empowering and supportive culture can be. We can primarily help ourselves and Buffer move forward at an incredible pace, and as a side effect we might attract some interest in the way we do things and be able to impact and help other companies too.\n<br/><br/>\nSuper excited to report back on what we come up with!\n<br/><br/>\nP.S.

That&#8217;s a key mistake I&#8217;ve been making a lot, and I&#8217;ve recently adjusted my expectations.</p>\n\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n\n<p>It is often said that <strong>if you choose a specific time in advance for a new habit, then it can help you to be more likely to follow through</strong>. For example, if you tell a friend that you will go to the gym in the next week, compared with telling them that you will go to the gym at 7:30am on Tuesday, you are more likely to go to the gym when you are more specific:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;There are several key elements in building effective energy-management rituals but none so important as specificity of timing and the precision of behavior during the thirty-to sixty-day acquisition period.&#8221; - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Power-Full-Engagement-Managing-Performance/dp/0743226755\">Tony Schwartz</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The flipside I&#8217;ve found, to this, is that <strong>if I choose a very specific time like 7:30am, then if that time comes by and goes, then I feel I have failed and the feeling of disappointment can stop me going at all</strong>, even though there is a lot of time left in the day. So, I try to combine this with a freedom to still go in the afternoon or evening and count that as success for my aim to create a habit, too. I let myself be sloppy with the timing of new habits, especially at the start.</p>\n\n<h3>Cheat</h3>\n\n<p>Another key reason I found I sometimes failed with new habits, was when I made them into big things and then fell short. Or even worse, they were so big in my mind that I didn&#8217;t even do it at all.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, if I decide to step up my gym routine and I aim to do 7 exercises, spending a whole hour in the gym, then some days I find that to be quite daunting. The problem with this is that it even stops me going to the gym for just a few minutes. What I do now instead is tell myself that <strong>if I go for 10 minutes and do just a single exercise, that counts too</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;the 20-minute walk I take is better than the 3-mile run I never start. Having people over for take-out is better than never having people to an elegant dinner party.&#8221; - <a href=\"http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2012/12/secret-of-adulthood-dont-let-the-perfect-be-the-enemy-of-the-good/\">Gretchen Ruben</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The interesting thing about this is that <strong>for the purpose of building new habits, going to the gym for 10 minutes is better than not going for 1 hour</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This blog post? it&#8217;s not as long as most I write. Both Gretchen Ruben quotes are from the same article. Yet, it&#8217;s still better than not shipping something this week.</p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/newtown_grafitti/6352670663/\">Newtown grafitti</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/1F9vxbWLpJg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/1F9vxbWLpJg/43351497798", :published_at => Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:01:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/43351497798", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
FeedEntry.create(:id => 473, :name => "The third option", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2429/3591571001_b2d6e316e2.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>In the recent months I&#8217;ve realized <strong>I am very much in a bubble. Everyone I know is building a company. Amongst my circle of friends, that is the norm.</strong> This, however, is mostly out of choice: I believe, in agreement with <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/10/the-easiest-way-to-thrive-as-an-outlier.html\">Seth Godin</a>, that to be an outlier is an inefficient way to make progress:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The easiest way to thrive as an outlier is to avoid being one. At least among your most treasured peers. Surround yourself with people in at least as much of a hurry, at least as inquisitive, at least as focused as you are.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that said, there was a time when I felt out of place. I was studying Computer Science, and all of my friends were making their choices about what to do after graduation. <strong>All  events and advice were centered around either getting a job, or  continuing onto further education. Those were the two options.</strong> The only options you&#8217;d find. I had other things in my mind. I was considering building my own business, creating a startup. <strong>A third option.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I fundamentally believe that <strong>this elusive third option should be talked about much more.</strong> I think there needs to be higher awareness that creating a startup is a real, tangible option for increasing numbers of students. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I speak at college and university events as often as I speak at some of the bigger scale events with more marketing potential. I hope to inspire a few people to take the third option.</p>\n\n<h3>My story</h3>\n\n<p>During my time studying, I was always doing side projects and freelance work. By the time I was approaching graduation, I had worked as a freelancer on the side for several years. As a result of my side projects and practical assignments, <strong>I had decided that I&#8217;d like to create a product:</strong> (something much more scalable and with my income not tied to time) instead of continuing freelance work or getting a regular job.</p>\n\n<p>So, after graduation, I took the plunge and tried to create my own startup. The third option. It&#8217;s certainly not a smooth path, it&#8217;s not the easy option. For some, it may never work out. For the next year and a half, I struggled to build a startup, and still worked as a freelancer to make ends meet. <strong>From the outside it may have seemed that I was not going anywhere.</strong> I made little progress with my startup, and I intentionally limited time I spent working as a freelancer.  Yet, that&#8217;s how it works with startups: it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://leostartsup.com/2012/10/growing-like-bamboo/\">the bamboo effect</a>. You&#8217;re accumulating learning. Suddenly it all comes together and you have an impact.</p>\n\n<p>After a year and a half of struggles with the first startup, I launched a little experiment called <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>. Two years later, it&#8217;s an eleven person company generating over a million dollars a year. I would like to say I would always have got here, but <strong>I know in my mind I was close to being influenced by the fact there were only two obvious choices for me</strong>. I luckily found a way to choose that third option no one talks about.</p>\n\n<h3>The upside of doing a startup</h3>\n\n<p>Building a startup is not for everyone. If, however, you think this path might be for you, I want to share some of the amazing benefits to my life that I&#8217;ve found as a result of choosing the third option.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things I like the most about building a startup is the immense freedom and responsibility which results. This is also true if you work for an early stage startup, and that could be a good first step too. The other side of the coin of this freedom and responsibility is that <strong>the choice of whether to get out of bed and keep going is only up to you</strong>. For me, this triggered a spiritual journey, where I have learned more about myself and what motivates me. It&#8217;s also why I&#8217;m always changing my routine and habits.</p>\n\n<p>The more direct upside is through learning and the potential to have your income not be tied to your time, and build wealth in a very short period of time. <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">Paul Graham</a> explained this in the best way I&#8217;ve come across:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Paul Graham is talking about takes hard work, but is achievable. <strong>A regular job doesn&#8217;t require too many hard conversations, or making decisions without complete information. This is what makes a startup harder.</strong> Paul Graham once again has a great way to put this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars&#8217; worth of pain&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fun way to live. I&#8217;ve never learned as much in a couple of years as I have building Buffer. I can definitely recommend it.</p>\n\n<h3>The opportunity cost of working a normal job</h3>\n\n<p>I have come to believe that <strong>not only is there a massive upside to building a startup, there is also an opportunity cost of working a regular job</strong>. That is to say - if you have the goal to eventually build a startup, then every moment you spend working a regular job is making you <em>less</em> experienced as a startup founder.</p>\n\n<p>Why would this be the case? Well, firstly, let&#8217;s look at the lifestyle implications of a regular job. A lot of smart folks will graduate and have good prospects of working at in investment banking or at a consultancy, and the salary potential is very high. So you get started and you have a nice apartment. Once you get a raise, you naturally upgrade your lifestyle. <strong>You soon reach a point where you have a lot to lose</strong> by cutting your salary in half or to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is it very easy to get used to the lifestyle promoted by the salary and the people you are around, you also learn to speak in a way which helps you as an investment banker, but not necessarily when you&#8217;re building a product or service for the masses. Most importantly, <strong>you are becoming an expert of something, and thereby losing the beginner&#8217;s mind</strong> which is <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/42713179646/expert-of-nothing\">vital to have as a startup founder</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Let&#8217;s encourage the third option</h3>\n\n<p>As a result of my own experience and the interaction I&#8217;ve had with students who could have been great founders, <strong>I believe the most useful thing we can all do is to provide encouragement for anyone who shows the smallest sign of considering the path of being a startup founder</strong>. Sure, there are risks and there will be failure, but there is immense learning and satisfaction ahead for those who choose the third option. <strong>Anyone can point out the dangers, that&#8217;s the easy thing to do. Let us be positive about the good things that could happen.</strong> Will you join me?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Did you consider the third option when you graduated, or are you nearing that point in your life and considering your options? I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeco/3591571001/\">jeco</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/yEeaGW2eLEw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/yEeaGW2eLEw/43329889248", :published_at => Thu, 21 Feb 2013 13:46:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/43329889248", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

A few years ago, this was my great friend <a href=\"http://twitter.com/KhuramMalik\">Khuram</a>, with whom I consistently had a weekly meeting for over a year. In the meeting, we discussed our achievements and challenges to help each other keep pushing forward.</p>\n\n<p>In the world of weight training, <strong>it is well known that having a partner helps with motivation and will mean you can lift more</strong> and see gains more quickly. Taking this a step further to the area of personal trainers, <a href=\"http://www.jssm.org/vol2/n1/2/v2n1-2pdf.pdf\">research has shown</a> that those who switch from training alone, to using a personal trainer see many improvements.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <strong>pair programming has become relatively well established and has shown to improve the quality of code, as well as <a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/166635/reasons-for-pair-programming\">keep both developers in &#8220;flow&#8221; state</a></strong> for a more sustained period of time.</p>\n\n<p>In the recent months I have been using these techniques in my day to day work on Buffer and my personal projects such as blogging. In essence, <strong>my co-founder <a href=\"http://twitter.com/leowid\">Leo</a> and I act as personal trainers for each other for our work and life goals</strong>. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<h3>Brainstorm blog posts together, in detail</h3>\n\n<p>When I started this blog, every post I wrote completely by myself. It can be done that way, but when Leo had come on board Buffer fully as a co-founder, I soon naturally started discussing future posts with him, and he was super encouraging and interested.</p>\n\n<p>These days, <strong>I deliberately brainstorm many of my articles with Leo, right down to the individual sections</strong>. It makes my writing task much easier, and the posts are better as a result.</p>\n\n<h3>Write a list for the next day</h3>\n\n<p>One of the activities Leo and I are trying to build as a habit right now, is to sit down together for 20 minutes at the end of each day, and plan the key tasks we each want to do the next day.</p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve found that <strong>whenever we plan the day ahead, we&#8217;re much more productive, procrastinate less, and feel happier as a result</strong>. This is something I can definitely recommend you do with your co-founders if you&#8217;re in the early stages, or if you&#8217;re part of a team you could try it with a co-worker.</p>\n\n<h3>Pull the other person in, even for your own tasks</h3>\n\n<p>Something I&#8217;ve just started doing, and encourage Leo to do as well, is <strong>whenever there&#8217;s something I need to work on myself, and I find myself struggling to get stuck into it, I will book a slot with Leo</strong> to ask him to work through it with me.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially useful for analyzing and brainstorming, where you need to map out many things and come to some conclusions. Although I do it with Leo, I am mostly leading it and it is one of those cases where <strong>simply explaining something to someone can help</strong> me a lot.</p>\n\n<h3>Weekly mastermind sessions</h3>\n\n<p>Perhaps <strong>the most productive two hours of my week are Friday night, where Leo and I always go to <a href=\"http://www.samovarlife.com/lounges/yerba-buena-gardens/\">Samovar</a>, drink tea and have a systematic mastermind session</strong> which I have learned and cultivated over the last few years. We share our achievements and the other person helps celebrate them and point out interesting patterns. Then, we discuss our biggest challenges right now, and help the other person find solutions or adjustments to make to improve. It&#8217;s something I look forward to every week, and I make real changes for the week ahead during every session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any activities which you do with a co-founder or co-worker which help you to progress faster or increase productivity?

Oh, and if you don&#8217;t embrace that reality, it&#8217;s probably going to affect your likelihood of success.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daniellemorrill.com/2013/02/i-dont-do-that-job-anymore/\">Danielle Morrill wrote</a> that <strong>there are a handful of roles that she became very good at, yet she no longer cares to play</strong>. As she continues her fascinating journey with <a href=\"http://refer.ly/\">Referly</a>, I feel I can relate to a lot of what she&#8217;s going through, from my experience with <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Huh - I was a coder?</h3>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s crazy. I haven&#8217;t coded more than a day every two weeks for over six months now, and I haven&#8217;t coded at all for the last two. <strong>If I look back at the whole of the last year, I wasn&#8217;t coding</strong>, I was doing a bunch of other things. Important things.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, looking back at my life and my identity, it&#8217;s largely been defined by programming. It was such a core part of who I was. I learned to code when I was 12, I was a freelance developer and I did Computer Science. So <strong>it feels odd that in just a year, I can be so distant from it. And that&#8217;s exactly how I need to feel.</strong> That&#8217;s what needs to happen for Buffer, and it&#8217;s what will help me grow the most, personally.</p>\n\n<h3>Repeatedly firing myself</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you&#8217;re a founding CEO, I believe that you are doing your company a disservice if you don&#8217;t fire yourself from your skill position.<br/>- <a href=\"http://joekraus.com/first-fire-thyself-2\">Joe Kraus</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For much of the first year, I was coding. <strong>I did whatever was needed to build the product</strong>, from design and front-end work to back-end and server admin. Then, we started looking for investment and everything changed. I had to learn how to pitch investors, how to describe our traction. Then I had to work with Leo to learn how to get press. We got into AngelPad and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tommoor\">Tom</a> immediately joined us. <strong>That was when I first fired myself</strong>. I was no longer the main coder, Tom took over and gradually all of my code was touched and improved in some way by Tom.</p>\n\n<p>That was <strong>a shock for me, to let go of my main thing</strong>. I got over it, and found a joy in the immense personal learning and growth of Buffer which we found as a result of my doing all these other things.</p>\n\n<p>A few months later, we realized the power of mobile for Buffer. <strong>I jumped in and learned to code Android, just enough to build a decent version of Buffer for Android</strong>. It was hard, I was stuck almost every day with a new challenge in Java. Then, just as I found my feet and gained confidence in the coding, I knew how truly fundamental mobile will be for us, so I knew I needed to hire someone to do it full-time. Sunil joined us and I gradually reduced my involvement in Android development. <strong>I never became an expert, then I fired myself</strong> and we found someone else.</p>\n\n<h3>Feeling lost, and getting used to it</h3>\n\n<p>Being an expert of nothing is draining, and something I never anticipated. <strong>There is a lot to do, and you don&#8217;t really know how to do any of it.</strong> On top of that, you&#8217;re supposed to be the leader, to know everything. You&#8217;re meant to be the expert that everyone can look to. They&#8217;re counting on you.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty hard at times, if I&#8217;m totally frank. <strong>There are days when I wonder what it is I even do anymore. Everything used to be so tangible</strong> - I would write a line of code, and it would do something for me. These days, there are these fluffy things like culture (and it&#8217;s <em>so</em> important), and I have to direct product and hire new people. I have to manage much of the team, and talk with investors. <strong>I truly have no idea what I&#8217;m doing - I have zero previous experience</strong> of hiring, or managing people, or being a product manager.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Every day I&#8217;m an expert of nothing.</strong> And just when I finally start to feel like I know how this role works, and the activities I need to do? That&#8217;s exactly the point when I need to hire someone to replace myself, so I can move onto the next thing I have no idea how to do.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;m starting to find a kind of peace and comfort in this place now. I quite like it. It is a real privilege to be able to experience it.</p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanf/4844875280/\">Daniel Novta</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/0T10Wtgj_0U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/0T10Wtgj_0U/42713179646", :published_at => Mon, 11 Feb 2013 16:14:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/42713179646", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
FeedEntry.create(:id => 476, :name => "The evening walk", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/6851590794_ba0b686528.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago I restarted <strong>one of my favorite habits: a daily evening walk</strong>. I want to share a couple of reasons why I love this habit so much, and how I recommend starting it if you find that you want to give it a try.</p>\n\n<h3>Disengagement from the busy day</h3>\n\n<p>One of the key reasons that the evening walk has become a crucial part of my daily routine is that it <strong>provides a powerful way to quickly become fully disengaged from the activities of the day</strong> and the plans, worries or excitement I have lingering.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written before that <strong>I believe the <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/39304339582/two-important-and-often-overlooked-aspects-of-creating\">evening routine is just as important as the morning routine</a></strong>, when trying to create a lasting early waking habit.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/primal/\">recent interview</a> with <a href=\"http://leobabauta.com/bio\">Leo Babauta</a>, <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/about-2/mark-sisson/\">Mark Sisson</a> <strong>recommended a tech cut-off time</strong> in the evening:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Set a tech cut-off time before bed. Shoot for at least an hour before you go to sleep, but strive to extend that period to two hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For me, <strong>the evening walk provides the perfect tech cut-off time</strong> and is a key reason I am able to sustain habits through the whole week.</p>\n\n<h3>Deliberate reflection</h3>\n\n<p>I recently set a goal of becoming <strong>a more frequent content creator, rather than simply a consumer or curator</strong>. I share a daily 3 minute voice clip on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/joelgascoigne\">SoundCloud</a>, I blog here usually twice a week and I create and share <a href=\"http://youtube.com/startuplifeshow\">a video once a week</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With this high frequency of sharing my thoughts through various forms of content, I need lots of ideas in order to be able to keep up that pace. Therefore, <strong>I started reflecting a lot around when exactly the breakthroughs of the ideas come</strong> - when the inspiration comes to me.</p>\n\n<p>What I realized, is that I have most of my ideas for blog posts, sound clips or videos through the combination of two things:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Spending time discussing startup and life challenges and ideas with my team, or with other founders.</li>\n<li>Time to reflect on the discussions I&#8217;ve had, to ponder the ideas by myself and let thoughts emerge with clarity.</li>\n</ol><p>After this discovery, I started deliberately working to do these two things even more. Firstly, I offer <a href=\"http://joel.is/startup-help\">help for founders</a> and generally have 30 minute office hours sessions with 6-8 people a week. Secondly, I scheduled time for the reflection to happen and the inspiration to hit me: by having a daily evening walk. <strong>Most people leave this to chance, their &#8220;inspiration&#8221; time being when they are in the shower. I try to be much more deliberate</strong> about it.</p>\n\n<p>The walk helps me wind down for the day and sleep better when I return, and it also is a time when I find I have inspiration for blog posts and voice clips, as well as many product, vision and culture ideas for <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>How to start an evening walk habit</h3>\n\n<p>If the evening walk sounds like something you want to try, I&#8217;d love to share some practical tips to start doing it. In the last two years I&#8217;ve lived in the UK, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Tel Aviv and during my time in each of these places I always quickly formed a specific and automatic evening walk habit.</p>\n\n<h4>1. Aim to walk for 20 minutes</h4>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried shorter than 20 minutes and I&#8217;ve also done 30 or 40 minutes at times, and I&#8217;ve found that <strong>20 minutes is, for me, the most ideal duration for the evening walk</strong>. It&#8217;s short enough that it&#8217;s easy to fit it in each day, especially when forming the habit to begin with. It&#8217;s long enough to gradually let go of the day to day excitement or worries, and let your mind wander and reflect on a higher level.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Plan a precise route, and stick to it</h4>\n\n<p>One of the most important aspects of the walk for me has been to quickly decide a route, and stick to it. The route should be very specific, down to almost each step. When creating a new evening walk habit, I plan each turn and visualize walking it in my mind. <strong>The power of this specificity is that it quickly becomes automatic</strong> and you forget about where you are going or what you are seeing, and can start to reflect inwards on what you are doing and whether you are happy. I usually walk much more slowly than my normal walking pace, and find <strong>I can start to ponder changes I want to make</strong> in my life.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Think backwards from when you want to sleep</h4>\n\n<p>To utilize the evening walk as a core part of your morning routine, the key is to think about when you want to awake, ensure that you will get 7-8 hours of sleep, and then <strong>work backwards from there to decide exactly when you should set off for your evening walk</strong>. Having a specific time to walk out of the door each day makes it much easier to create the habit. I leave at 7:30.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you tried having a daily evening walk routine? Do you find it helps you to make progress with the most important things in your life? Or, do you think you will try it? I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tambako/6851590794/\">Tambako the Jaguar</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/Pgdn375bMvY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/Pgdn375bMvY/41028577733", :published_at => Sun, 03 Feb 2013 19:39:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/41028577733", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

It&#8217;s this elusive thing, where tangible benefits are not often associated and even the practicalities of what the activity is, are often not discussed.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all of this, <strong>I&#8217;ve recently started regularly meditating</strong> as soon as I awake in the morning, and just before I sleep in the evening. I&#8217;ve <strong>found this to have a profound effect on my life and my ability to succeed as a CEO</strong>, so I wanted to share the benefits you might get from forming a habit of meditation yourself:</p>\n\n<h3>1. You will easily handle the inevitable ups and downs</h3>\n\n<p>One thing you can be sure of if you run a startup, is that it&#8217;s not all going to be plain sailing. <strong>You&#8217;re going to have to change your mind, you&#8217;re going to run into unexpected events</strong> and there are going to be days where nothing works out.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that my <strong>daily morning and evening meditation helps me to reduce how dramatically these highs and lows can effect my ability to keep moving forward</strong> and make progress. Through simply focusing on my breathing for at least 5 minutes each morning, I am brought back to the present moment and over time, I become more and more tolerant to the ups and downs that arise.</p>\n\n<h3>2. It will save you time, by reducing procrastination</h3>\n\n<p>I truly believe that <strong>the purpose of meditation is simply to meditate, but there are of course some amazing benefits that come as a result</strong>. I focus on &#8220;now&#8221; when I meditate, and if you&#8217;ve tried to do this you will know how hard it can be. As soon as you close your eyes to meditate, you think about what you&#8217;ll do today, whether your metrics will grow as they need to, even what you&#8217;ll eat for breakfast and how much time is left on the counter for your meditation session.</p>\n\n<p>The result of having all these unhealthy thoughts come into your mind while you meditate, is that <strong>you are practicing letting these thoughts come in and then leave your mind</strong>, and you are therefore improving your ability to be unaffected by distractions. I&#8217;ve found this carries over to my workday and makes me much more productive.</p>\n\n<h3>3. You will have bursts of creative genius</h3>\n\n<p>Often <strong>after my meditation session I feel so renewed and my mind is so clear</strong>, that the activity afterwards is filled with much more creativity. Whether I sit down to work on a most important task, I go to the gym, or I take a shower, I seem to have breakthroughs when I&#8217;m doing an activity just after meditating.</p>\n\n<p>Try it for a week. Meditate for just 3 minutes, or try 5 if you can. <a href=\"http://www.dumblittleman.com/2007/12/meditation-techniques-for-busy-or.html\">There are many ways to meditate</a>. Personally, <strong>I simply sit cross-legged on a cushion, close my eyes, and focus on breathing in and out</strong>. If you try it, I truly believe you will find that you have many more useful thoughts on a consistent basis. In the evening I am doing guided meditation with <a href=\"http://www.getsomeheadspace.com/\">Headspace</a>, which is also great.</p>\n\n<h3>4. You will feel alive and healthy and have better sleep</h3>\n\n<p>After I started doing my daily evening meditation session, my sleep became much better. I usually struggle to sleep, and I often have all kinds of thoughts swirling around in my head. <strong>After 5 minutes of meditation, those thoughts are emptied from my mind and I&#8217;ve found it easier to fall asleep</strong>, and in addition the <a href=\"http://www.dumblittleman.com/2008/09/5-ways-to-fall-asleep-quicker.html\">quality of my sleep has been higher</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Through meditation, I have learned to respect my body and be grateful for it. <strong>I&#8217;m much healthier and I find it easier to restrain myself with food</strong>, in a similar way that I have found I can avoid procrastinating. Overall, I feel much more alive.</p>\n\n<h3>5. It will make you happy and you&#8217;ll find meaning</h3>\n\n<p>A great result of feeling alive, healthy and spending more time in the present moment, is that you will naturally be happier. <strong>Being happy is being in the present moment. The most common times I&#8217;m unhappy are when I&#8217;m thinking about the past or the future, so meditation makes me happy.</strong> Through regular meditation, I&#8217;ve had deeper and deeper sessions where my mind has become even more clear and I&#8217;ve let go of my day-to-day worries. This has helped me to much more easily reflect on what I truly want to achieve through my role as the CEO of a startup, and in life itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you tried a habit of daily meditation? If not, what&#8217;s stopping you? I&#8217;d love to hear about your experiences.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/crdot/6903711925/\">Caleb Roenigk</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/sa2UKdallp8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/sa2UKdallp8/41942221925", :published_at => Thu, 31 Jan 2013 13:15:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/41942221925", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

In particular, people very frequently wait far too long before launching.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key learnings for me with <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a> was that <strong>the impact of problems people have and downtime they experience are directly tied to how we, as a startup, choose to handle it</strong>.

Swindoll</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Buffer grew from a few hundred users to tens of thousands in the first six months, we hit some scaling issues, in particular as a result of my lack of experience in scaling MySQL (as an aside, we&#8217;ve since <a href=\"http://blog.tommoor.com/post/25347302754/scaling-a-lean-startup-the-story-so-far\">moved to MongoDB</a>). I quickly learned how to optimize queries and which indexes to add. I often needed to resize the single Linode instance Buffer was hosted on. As a result, <strong>there were times of both unexpected as well as deliberate downtime</strong> in the early days of Buffer.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most remarkable things we found <strong>during these periods of downtime, was that if we were super responsive on Twitter, we could actually gain some very loyal Buffer supporters</strong>. The scenario would be that I (or later, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/tommoor\">Tom</a> and I) would be hard at work fixing the issues, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/leowid\">Leo</a> would be 100% focused on responding to Tweets within seconds. What we found, which is very counterintuitive, was that in some ways <strong>by being down, we had emerged in a better position afterwards than we were beforehand</strong>. This insight helped us to be much calmer about downtime in the future.</p>\n\n<h3>With bugs in the wild, you&#8217;re forced to work harder and faster. Your product improves quickly.</h3>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that <strong>some of the hardest stages of creating a new startup are those early weeks or months when you&#8217;re racing to get your product ready for initial launch</strong>. You&#8217;re trying to decide how polished the product should be, and how many features you need to include.</p>\n\n<p>Through my own experience and speaking to other founders who have launched products, I&#8217;ve found that we almost always say we should have launched sooner. The thing is, <strong>when something is live, that&#8217;s where all the learning happens</strong>. Until you put it out there and get real usage, you&#8217;re sat in the dark coding and have no idea if it will work.</p>\n\n<p>I would even go as far as to say that <strong>you should &#8220;push it live&#8221; when there are still a few bugs or it doesn&#8217;t look perfect</strong>. Once it&#8217;s out there, you&#8217;re going to fix them faster, and your users will find and tell you about problems you had no idea about. Doing this is a nice hack to increase your productivity: I&#8217;ve found that when I did this especially in the early days, I always had a great todo list and was compelled to work away at the items. Essentially, the product will improve much more quickly than if you work quietly in stealth mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Handling challenges and pressure is a key skill for startup teams</h3>\n\n<p>One of the things that is often said is that <strong>startups are inherently a process where there is a massive amount of uncertainty</strong>. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alyssaaldersley\">Alyssa</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ay8s\">Andy</a> in the team certainly know that <strong>we can change our minds about even fundamental aspects of Buffer literally from one day to the next</strong>. It takes a certain type of person to be able to handle this kind of environment.</p>\n\n<p>With this uncertainty, often those involved with a startup are faced with some fairly pressurised situations, whether it is downtime or figuring out and fixing some critical bug quickly. I think <strong>these times are really the ones where, more than anything, the team needs to remain optimistic and positive</strong>. Therefore, any bugs or downtime that comes up, is yet another opportunity to practice these traits and in some cases to find out who can see those situations through while remaining calm and productive.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing that we&#8217;ve often found at Buffer, is that we look back on the downtime and those times where we are up all night figuring out how to get Buffer back up and realise that <strong>in those few hours we&#8217;ve learned a massive amount</strong>. In that light, we don&#8217;t wish that those scenarios wouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the bugs and downtime that comes inevitably with any startup venture? I&#8217;d love to hear about your experiences.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/beardenb/86531200/\">Bearden</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/vAy3cs6mHEo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/vAy3cs6mHEo/40447951966", :published_at => Mon, 14 Jan 2013 14:17:33 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/40447951966", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
FeedEntry.create(:id => 479, :name => "What is failure for you?", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1389/1137484283_114df5e790.jpg\" width=\"500px\" height=\"334px\"/></p>\n\n<p>One thing I realised over the holiday period is that my definition of failure in a couple of things had changed considerably since the year before.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, in the year of 2012 I built up my gym routine to the point where for the final 3 months, I went to the gym consistently 5 times per week. During the holidays, <strong>I &#8220;failed&#8221; with my 5 times per week routine, but this meant that I still went to the gym 2-3 times a week</strong> during that time.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly with blogging, I&#8217;m now aiming to write 2-3 times per week, and so for me to &#8220;fail&#8221; with blogging means that I write once a week.</p>\n\n<h3>The role of failure and imperfection in building skills</h3>\n\n<blockquote><p>Failure is part of success, an integral part. - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach)\">Bill Walsh</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written before that <strong>I believe <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/36591651818/want-to-create-a-new-habit-get-ready-to-break-it\">imperfection is a key part of building habits</a></strong> and gaining skills. To sit down and decide a new goal or habit and expect to flawlessly go ahead and achieve it is unproductive. Instead, I think <strong>the best plan is to expect to miss the mark several times</strong> along the way.</p>\n\n<p>The key to simultaneously expecting imperfection and not allowing it to get you down and cause you to bail on your idea, is perspective. For me, <strong>once I take a moment to realise just how far I&#8217;ve come, despite the fact I&#8217;ve failed at this moment, that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s easy to still be happy</strong> with that failure and then move forward towards being better the next week.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been blogging once a month for 6 months, then you step it up to twice a month and achieve that for the first two months but fall short the third, <strong>don&#8217;t be too disappointed. Remember that eight months ago you weren&#8217;t even blogging at all</strong>, and this &#8216;failure&#8217; probably just means you&#8217;ve blogged once a month. It&#8217;s always a process of gradual improvement.</p>\n\n<h3>Your failure is highly individual</h3>\n\n<blockquote><p>We constantly compare our beginning to someone else’s middle. Our middle to someone else’s end. And when you do that – you’ll find that you’re never, ever satisfied. You’ll never, ever be good enough. You’ll always struggle to celebrate your accomplishments. - <a href=\"http://www.lifewithoutpants.com/someone-elses-middle/\">Matt Cheuvront</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the hardest things I&#8217;ve found to grasp and be aware of, is that <strong>to each person, failure has a different definition</strong>. We are all at different stages, and our journeys are very different too. As Matt Cheuvront says, we&#8217;re always comparing ourselves to others when it makes zero sense to do that.</p>\n\n<p>A most important thing with this, is that <strong>if you feel like you have failed with something, make sure that failure is your own</strong> and not someone else&#8217;s. If you&#8217;re hitting the gym twice a week and meet someone who is going to the gym every day, don&#8217;t let that make you feel like a failure. Our own goals and habits are completely individual to us. I think <strong>one of my biggest satisfactions comes from continually improving my personal bests, whether it&#8217;s running or lifting weights, blogging or speaking</strong>. Once you get into a habit of beating yourself continually, you can make some amazing progress.</p>\n\n<h3>Adjusting your definition of failure over time</h3>\n\n<p>The other fascinating thing I&#8217;ve found, is that <strong>in just one year you can dramatically change what failure means for you</strong>. You can go from your highest success scenario becoming your &#8220;failure&#8221; scenario. This is very encouraging for me. It means that <strong>for example, in a year from now I can gradually work towards daily blogging, and by that point my &#8220;failure&#8221; might be that I only blog 3 times per week</strong>, which is my current success scenario.</p>\n\n<p>It was a reassuring thought for me over the holidays that despite the fact I felt like I was failing by not keeping up my routine of going to the gym 5 times per week, <strong>I was still going 2-3 times a week and this was a lot more than I was doing a year earlier</strong>. So, the key is to <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/39474807889/focus-on-the-line-not-the-dot\">think about the line you are creating</a> rather than the individual dots.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do you often accidentally allow failure to get you down without realising how far you have come? Do you sometimes compare your journey to others? I&#8217;ve been a victim of these things before, and I&#8217;m working to change that, and make real progress in my own individual path. I&#8217;d love any thoughts you have on this topic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/behruz/1137484283/\">Behrooz Nobakht</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/y_PYBpO0Vw4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/y_PYBpO0Vw4/40255236566", :published_at => Fri, 11 Jan 2013 14:46:51 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/40255236566", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
FeedEntry.create(:id => 480, :name => "Zero notifications", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/Lz9y/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-06%20at%2017.34.24.png\" width=\"500px\" height=\"285px\"/></p>\n\n<p>A couple of months ago, my co-founder <a href=\"http://twitter.com/leowid\">Leo</a> gave me an interesting suggestion: he said I should <strong>try disabling all notifications on my iPhone</strong>. I find this suggestion especially interesting because it is one that goes against the normal phone setup. <strong>It&#8217;s so usual to stick to how things are</strong>, and with iPhone apps the easiest thing to do is to &#8220;allow&#8221; all those notifications. It seems almost odd to even consider doing things any other way.</p>\n\n<p>I chose to go along with Leo&#8217;s suggestion, although <strong>I was admittedly quite skeptical that it would change much</strong>. I imagined that I had pretty good willpower, and that I am fairly productive already. <strong>Just because I got notifications, I didn&#8217;t think that affected my workflow all too much</strong>. In hindsight looking back though, one clear indication that it was already affecting my was that I was regularly turning my phone over to stop those notifications lighting up the screen and distracting me.</p>\n\n<h3>What it&#8217;s like to live without notifications</h3>\n\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Confuse the Urgent with the Important&#8221; - <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/communication-success/201206/how-be-ultra-productive-10-tips-mastering-your-time-now\">Preston Ni</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>For the first week that I turned off notifications, I checked Twitter, Facebook, Email and other places regularly. In fact, I still do, although maybe not so much as that first week. After a couple of weeks, <strong>I came to love the fact that nothing came onto my lock screen or lit up my phone</strong>. I even found that I frequently started to use the switch in Mac OSX to turn off desktop notifications until the next day.</p>\n\n<p>With zero notifications, I feel like I can get my head stuck into a problem much more easily than I did before. I never realised when I had those notifications on that they truly could throw me off my current thought and cause me difficulty getting that focus back. <strong>More than anything, I feel a lot calmer. Notifications create a sense of urgency around something that&#8217;s not important at all</strong>. I don&#8217;t need to know <em>right now</em> that someone liked my status on Facebook.</p>\n\n<h3>It changes the balance, it&#8217;s now my choice</h3>\n\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are two types of people: One strives to control his environment, the other strives not to let his environment control him. I like to control my environment&#8221; - <a href=\"http://longform.org/stories/playboy-interview-george-carlin\">George Carlin</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The thing I like the most about turning off all notifications is that <strong>it is now completely up to me when I choose to check my email, Twitter, Facebook, etc</strong>. I have no excuse that a notification came in. If I check it too frequently and find myself procrastinating, it is only my fault: I went out of my way to go and look. As <a href=\"http://sivers.org\">Derek Sivers</a> puts it, <a href=\"http://sivers.org/my-fault\">&#8220;everything is my fault&#8221;</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing! Now you weren’t wronged. They were just playing their part in the situation you created. They’re just delivering the punch-line to the joke you set up.\n\nWhat power! Now you’re like a new super-hero, just discovering your strength. Now you’re the powerful person that made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it. Now you’re in control and there’s nothing to complain about.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It was my fault that I received push notifications, too, but by controlling that part of my environment everything is so much more pronounced. And now that it&#8217;s my fault, I can work solely myself to be better, to check those notifications less.</p>\n\n<h3>I choose to avoid reliance on willpower</h3>\n\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;we each have one reservoir of will and discipline, and it is depleted by any act of conscious self-regulation—whether that’s resisting a cookie, solving a puzzle, or doing anything else that requires effort.&#8221; - Tony Schwartz and Jean Gomes in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Way-Were-Working-Isnt-Performance/dp/074359746X\">The Way We&#8217;re Working Isn&#8217;t Working</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>The other reason I am happy that I&#8217;ve turned off all notifications, is that <strong>wherever possible I like to avoid relying on willpower or self-discipline</strong>. As Tony Schwartz and Jean Gomes put it, we all have a limited reservoir of willpower, and by turning off notifications it means I save some of that for other tasks rather than using it on resisting checking on each push notification that comes in. I&#8217;m certainly not suddenly a superhuman with complete focus at all times, but I feel much more in control.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you tried turning off notifications? I can highly recommend trying it, just for a week. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on this.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ostrosky/4197584789/\">Christian Ostrosky</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/YzRwFqzzd0s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/YzRwFqzzd0s/39927202947", :published_at => Mon, 07 Jan 2013 13:41:43 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/39927202947", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
FeedEntry.create(:id => 481, :name => "How to gain traction in two sided markets", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/e1df6020442c5d5dfaf8700966b56e59/tumblr_inline_mg3u3mCCOe1qzbj2n.png\" width=\"500px\" height=\"300px\"/></p>\n\n<p>Startup ideas that involve <strong>two sided markets are notoriously difficult to get off the ground</strong>. It&#8217;s the age-old chicken and egg problem. You need lots of buyers for the sellers to be interested, and you need lots of sellers for the buyers to be interested. The same goes for the recruitment space, and many other verticals too.</p>\n\n<p>I myself have failed in a two sided market, where <strong>I once tried to build a product which would <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/14/onepage-wants-to-make-business-cards-a-thing-of-the-past/\">kill the business card</a>. It would only work if everyone used the product</strong> and exchanged their business cards using my platform. Or so I thought.</p>\n\n<p>While I don&#8217;t have any direct personal experience of solving the two sided market problem, I have now been involved in startups for quite some time and have helped over 100 people through 1:1 Skype calls and coffee meetings, and <strong>gaining traction in a network effects startup is a challenge that comes frequently</strong>. Here are the two ways I would go about building traction for a product in a two sided market:</p>\n\n<h3>Go super niche</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing I would advise is to think about just how narrow you could go with the first iteration of your product. <strong>The more niche you go, the smaller the market becomes. The smaller the market, the easier it is to gain a critical mass within that market</strong> and become the defacto product for the audience.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the smaller and more focused you make the market, the more you can <strong>do specific things which will make your product the better option than any others</strong>. I think there is a reason Facebook did so well in the early days when it only supported Harvard and other colleges. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--APdD6vejI\">Zuckerberg mentioned in an early interview</a> that by staying more focused they could provide more value:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>There was a level of service that we could provide when we were just at Harvard that we can&#8217;t provide for all the colleges, and there&#8217;s a level of service that we can provide when we&#8217;re a college network which we couldn’t provide if we went to other types of things.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I would encourage you to think &#8220;what can I do to provide value for a much smaller niche market that might not necessarily scale?&#8221;. This means to <strong>provide value very specific to that niche market, that might not apply to other markets</strong> you later want to support. That&#8217;s an interesting thing I&#8217;ve learned: <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/12790799237/achieving-scale-by-doing-things-that-dont-scale\">methods you use early to gain traction don&#8217;t need to be able to scale</a> as you grow.</p>\n\n<p>Usually a great plan is to <strong>go truly niche by picking a specific location as well as specific use case, then expand outwards</strong>. Chris Dixon has a great article on using this method, he calls it the <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2010/08/21/the-bowling-pin-strategy/\">bowling pin strategy</a>. For example, Facebook focused on Harvard, and students. Yelp on San Francisco and dining out. Think about what&#8217;s the best focus for your idea.</p>\n\n<h3>Have a single player mode</h3>\n\n<p>The other great way to gain traction when getting started with an idea in a two sided market, is to essentially <strong>avoid the &#8220;two sides&#8221; aspect all together</strong>. While it is very powerful to have network effects at a later stage and can help trigger fast growth, in the beginning attracting both sides is a tough problem to solve.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, I&#8217;ve seen that <strong>most ideas have one side which has many problems and could actually benefit from a &#8220;tool&#8221; of some sort</strong> in addition to the benefits that are provided with the other side of the market. The idea is that the features which involve both sides of the market (for example, repinning, commenting and browsing others&#8217; pins on Pinterest) are the <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2010/06/12/designing-products-for-single-and-multiplayer-modes/\">&#8220;multiplayer mode&#8221; of the product</a>. If you can also provide a &#8220;single player mode&#8221; (for example, creating your own personal pinboard of great pictures you find and want to save) then this can be very powerful for gaining the initial traction when the userbase is small.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve observed that <strong>often founders have not considered that they could provide a tool for one side of the market</strong> and this could give them a way to get the product off the ground, while still retaining the multiplayer aspect for later benefit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are you building a startup which inherently has network effects and the challenge of the chicken and egg problem to gain traction? Have you thought about these two techniques? I&#8217;d love your thoughts on the topic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplyboaz/5408077644\">Simply Boaz</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/3Uudfi3zit8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/3Uudfi3zit8/39659497239", :published_at => Fri, 04 Jan 2013 15:31:47 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/39659497239", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

If you&#8217;re hiring, it&#8217;s a great place to share that fact. Since around half a year ago, we&#8217;ve been actively hiring and so I&#8217;ve made it a task of mine to post to the thread when it appears on the first of the month.</p>\n\n<p>As I sat down to write the <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4993197\">listing</a> for <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a> in the thread yesterday, <strong>the writing came very easily</strong>. At the same time, those words I wrote on that thread have had a huge impact. The listing itself gained 11 points and was placed 2nd out of all job listings. In the hours that followed, <strong>I have received over 30 emails from super interesting people</strong> interested in joining the team.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I realized is that the blogging is the reason that this happened. I&#8217;ve now written over <a href=\"http://joel.is/lessons\">70 articles on this blog</a>, mostly around 700-800 words. <strong>That&#8217;s over 50,000 words I&#8217;ve written, and I would guess that by writing that much you are only going to get better</strong>. That&#8217;s why it came so naturally for me to write that job listing.</p>\n\n<h3>How focusing on the dot feels</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/LtLo/focusing%20on%20the%20dot.png\" width=\"485px\" height=\"285px\"/></p>\n\n<div class=\"share-image\">Share this image: <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjoel.is%2Fpost%2F39474807889%2Ffocus-on-the-line-not-the-dot&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fjoelg.cc%2FLtLo%2Ffocusing%2520on%2520the%2520dot.png&amp;description=What%20it%20feels%20like%20to%20focus%20on%20the%20dot\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"none\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\"/></a> <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/add\" class=\"buffer-add-button\" data-text=\"What it feels like to focus on the dot\" data-url=\"http://joel.is/post/39474807889/focus-on-the-line-not-the-dot\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"joelgascoigne\" data-picture=\"http://joelg.cc/LtLo/focusing%20on%20the%20dot.png\">Buffer</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://static.bufferapp.com/js/button.js\"></script></div>\n\n<p>You see, what I&#8217;ve found is that <strong>if I ever stop and try to focus too much on any single article, and try and have a massive impact with one specific article, it becomes very unfulfilling</strong>. Although there are <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/29704334130/6-things-i-do-to-be-consistently-happy\">one</a> or <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/34817862059/start-something-small\">two</a> article which have had a tremendous impact for me, I had no idea at the time I was writing them.</p>\n\n<p>The way I see it is that <strong>when you focus on the dot, you focus on your impact between one workout and the next</strong>. You focus on your writing between one blog post and the next. You focus on the quality of your code between one line and the next.

This happens every single week. One week to the next doesn&#8217;t feel like huge progress, but <strong>if I just extrapolate that trend out, it means that within a few months I am going to be lifting a further twenty or thirty pounds</strong> on the bench press. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll be able to do that without having a higher muscle mass, so therefore <strong>in a few months I am going to be in better shape</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Start thinking about being a line</h3>\n\n<p>So, my conclusion from all of this is that <strong>personally I am much more focused on daily habits and consistency than any single point or any future goal</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/msuster\">Mark Suster</a> said that he <a href=\"http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/11/15/invest-in-lines-not-dots/\">invests in lines, not dots</a>. His advice for us as entrepreneurs is to treat our fundraising strategy as a line, not a dot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>don’t allocate two months of each year to “hardcore funding activities” but allocate a regular amount of time each month to it like any other job function.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_Glass\">Ira Glass</a> has a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/24715531\">fantastic video</a> which hints at this idea too:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a gap. That for the first couple of years, that you are making stuff, what you are making isn’t so good. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not that good.</p>\n  \n  <p>The most important, possible thing you could do is to do a lot of work. Do a huge volume of work. Because it’s only by actually going through a volume of work that you are actually going to catch up and close that gap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Are you focused on dots when you might make more progress by focusing on lines, by thinking about consistency?

I&#8217;m always making adjustments to it, and at its core <strong>it revolves around waking up early (before sunrise), working on something important for an 90 minutes, and then <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/24064139389/the-exercise-habit\">hitting the gym</a></strong>. I recently shared <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/36591651818/want-to-create-a-new-habit-get-ready-to-break-it\">my most recent routine</a> in a blog post about creating new habits.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I want to share a couple of things which I&#8217;ve neglected to mention in previous articles about my routine. These two aspects have enabled me to create a morning routine that has lasted several months, and <strong>it&#8217;s through my morning routine truly becoming habitual that I&#8217;ve seen massive benefits.</strong> I hope that these two insights can help you, too.</p>\n\n<h3>Why wake up early in the first place?</h3>\n\n<p>Before I jump into those two key insights that helped me, I want to share some of my thoughts about why you might want to wake up early at all.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I&#8217;ve observed that many of the most successful people wake up early. In fact, <strong>I don&#8217;t know anyone who consistently wakes up before 6am and isn&#8217;t doing something interesting with their life</strong>. Some of the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/successful-early-risers-2012-1?op=1\">top CEOs are well known for waking up super early</a>, many of them at 4:30am.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I feel that waking up early sets the tone for my day of &#8220;making a choice&#8221;. If I leave it to fate as to when I roll out of bed, then I feel like that&#8217;s the outlook I&#8217;m taking in general. On the other hand, <strong>if I choose to get up early and do amazing things in those quiet hours, that&#8217;s when I feel like I&#8217;m grabbing hold of my life and controlling where I go</strong>. That&#8217;s the choice I want to make.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to ask you - are you working for someone else and have desires to create your own startup? If that&#8217;s the case, then <strong>do you leave your &#8220;startup building time&#8221; to the evening?</strong> Why do it after 8 hours of work? You&#8217;re going to be exhausted and struggle to be motivated. I advise you to think about <strong>what is a higher priority for you - your dream of a startup, or your work for someone else?</strong> Perhaps start <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/22893893905/work-harder-on-yourself-than-you-do-on-your-startup\">working harder on yourself than on your job</a>. When I started Buffer whilst working 5 days per week, it was the choice to work an hour first thing in the morning each day when I was freshest that made a huge difference.</p>\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re thinking about starting starting an early morning routine, here are two things which took me a while to notice:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Craft your evening routine to get enough sleep</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/Lrhe/two-tips-evening-routine-simple.png\" width=\"485px\" height=\"285px\"/></p>\n\n<div class=\"share-image\">Share this image: <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjoel.is%2Fpost%2F39304339582%2Ftwo-important-and-often-overlooked-aspects-of-creating&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fjoelg.cc%2FLrhe%2Ftwo-tips-evening-routine-simple.png&amp;description=To%20create%20a%20lasting%20early%20morning%20routine%2C%20being%20disciplined%20with%20an%20evening%20routine%20is%20important.\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"none\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\"/></a> <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/add\" class=\"buffer-add-button\" data-text=\"To create a lasting early morning routine, being disciplined with an evening routine is important.\" data-url=\"http://joel.is/post/39304339582/two-important-and-often-overlooked-aspects-of-creating\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"joelgascoigne\" data-picture=\"http://joelg.cc/Lrhe/two-tips-evening-routine-simple.png\">Buffer</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://static.bufferapp.com/js/button.js\"></script></div>\n\n<p>One of the most important things I&#8217;ve found when I have attempted to keep up an early morning routine for several days and weeks in a row, is that <strong>if I let my daily sleep amount get much below 7 hours for too many consecutive days, I will burn out</strong> sooner or later.</p>\n\n<p>The best way I have found to counteract this, is to decide how much sleep I need (for me it&#8217;s about 7.5 hours a night) and then figure out the exact time I need to be in bed. Once I&#8217;ve done this, <strong>I set up a 30 minute winding down ritual (for me, it&#8217;s <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/5303723252/creating-a-sleep-ritual\">going for a walk</a>) which allows me to disengage from the day&#8217;s work</strong> and not have work in my head when I hit the pillow.</p>\n\n<p>The key thing I&#8217;ve found, is that in order to wake up early over a sustained period of weeks, this evening ritual is just as important as how much I think about my morning routine.</p>\n\n<h3>2. Wake up early at the weekend too</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/Lrg5/two-tips-weekend-routine.png\" width=\"484px\" height=\"411px\"/></p>\n\n<div class=\"share-image\">Share this image: <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjoel.is%2Fpost%2F39304339582%2Ftwo-important-and-often-overlooked-aspects-of-creating&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fjoelg.cc%2FLrg5%2Ftwo-tips-weekend-routine.png&amp;description=Wake%20up%20early%20at%20the%20weekend%20too.\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"none\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\"/></a> <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com/add\" class=\"buffer-add-button\" data-text=\"Wake up early at the weekend too\" data-url=\"http://joel.is/post/39304339582/two-important-and-often-overlooked-aspects-of-creating\" data-count=\"none\" data-via=\"joelgascoigne\" data-picture=\"http://joelg.cc/Lrg5/two-tips-weekend-routine.png\">Buffer</a><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://static.bufferapp.com/js/button.js\"></script></div>\n\n<p>Another key aspect I&#8217;ve found to having a consistent early morning routine over a long period of time, is to <strong>pay particular attention to the weekend as well as the week</strong>. I certainly believe that allowing imperfection and some slack at the weekend is important, but <strong>I personally made the mistake of having a weekend wake up time which was too divergent from my week day wake up time</strong>. Only once I started to think about the weekend, I hit a chain of many days of early mornings.</p>\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided when you want to wake up during the week, I recommend that you <strong>don&#8217;t wake up much more than 1 hour later at the weekend</strong>. This also probably means that you still need to go to bed quite early on Friday and Saturday night. The problem arises when you wake up several hours later on Saturday and Sunday, and then want to wake up super early again on Monday.</p>\n\n<p>The most likely thing is that Monday will be a little later, and Tuesday too. Perhaps by Wednesday you are back to your early morning waking time, but you will not feel that <strong>magical state of gliding along, having several days in a row of early mornings and productive quiet hours</strong>. If you don&#8217;t try to wake up at a similar time at the weekend, it is similar to giving yourself jet lag every weekend. By waking up at a similar time at the weekend, you don&#8217;t stretch your body, and therefore you can achieve long term consistency with your morning routine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you tried to have a long lasting early morning routine? Have you encountered either of these two challenges? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts and experiences with your morning routine.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/shinez/4214773218/\">Jack Jo</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/nBkuB1IL5IM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/nBkuB1IL5IM/39304339582", :published_at => Mon, 31 Dec 2012 14:12:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/39304339582", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

At the same time, I also aim for my talks to be a little inspirational too, by sharing how <strong>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to achieve some astonishing milestones despite the fact that I&#8217;m certainly no smarter than anyone else</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of this particular talk, someone asked me a really fantastic question, which was &#8220;you&#8217;ve shared great lessons, tips and some amazing achievements, but <strong>what has been the lowest point in this journey so far?</strong>&#8221;. It is a great question and there&#8217;s certainly one moment that stands out amongst others as one of the hardest times I&#8217;ve had with <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>A choice to raise funding</h3>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"http://twitter.com/leowid\">Leo</a> and I jumped on a plane to San Francisco around one and a half years ago, what we didn&#8217;t realise at the time is that <strong>in hindsight this was a clear turning point for us personally, and for Buffer as a startup</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>When we first arrived, we quickly set up a number of different meetings. <strong>Notable people we met were <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hnshah\">Hiten Shah</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/danielbru\">Daniel Brusilovsky</a> amongst a number of other founders</strong> at different stages of their startup career, including a few <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com\">YCombinator</a> founders.</p>\n\n<p>What we quickly realised through conversations with people was that <strong>we could keep growing slowly and solidly without funding</strong>, but we were at a point with good traction and a clear bottleneck in terms of me being the only person working on the whole product and all technical aspects, where <strong>if we had some funding we could grow the team more quickly and get much faster growth</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Leo and I always have a very positive outlook which helps us a lot, so <strong>we quickly decided it made sense to raise investment and whilst we had no idea how to do that, we agreed that it was simply another thing we would figure out</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Switching our focus to fundraising</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, since we had literally no idea how raising funding worked, we asked many many people for advice, and we started to take action right away to attempt to make progress. One thing we were sure of was that we should try our best to reach out to investors and have meetings. <strong>We were scared to talk to investors since we didn&#8217;t know how to pitch or how the process works, but we knew that was exactly what we needed to do.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Due to our lack of experience and knowledge, we worked jointly on fundraising. <strong>We sat down together in various coffee shops and sent out dozens of emails to investors, to other founders and to people who had become casual advisors.</strong> We learned many things, including that you should always get an introduction to an investor, and that you should <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/38630870504/how-to-get-more-replies-to-the-emails-you-send-be\">be very specific with a call to action in emails</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the important things we discovered, was that <strong>there should always be a clear focus of any pitch</strong>. Most pitches have similar content sections such as the market, a problem, your solution, current traction and the team. However, <strong>each individual startup will have a single aspect which is the strongest part of the pitch</strong>. For us, this was definitely our traction; Buffer already had 25,000 users, monthly revenues around $1,500 and we were growing 10% week over week.</p>\n\n<p>The great thing was: it is often said that <strong>when pitching, <a href=\"http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/07/traction-trumps-everything.html\">traction trumps everything</a></strong>. Certainly looking back, since we were first time founders with no track record, <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/18315636274/raising-funding-as-a-first-time-founder\">traction was even more important</a>. The problem was, whilst traction was the key part of our pitch and the traction was good, <strong>as soon as we switched our focus to fundraising our traction slowed</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>A difficult few weeks of learning</h3>\n\n<p>The traction which we were proud of was largely driven by a lot of hard work. <strong>For the six months previous, the only focus Leo and I had was to build a great product which solved a real need, and to market it</strong> so that people who would find it useful knew that it existed.</p>\n\n<p>We learned that fundraising is a full-time task, so what happened next was that around <strong>three weeks into fundraising, around three weeks after we had almost stopped working on the product and marketing altogether, our traction started to slow dramatically</strong>. We had some long-tail traffic, but a large portion of the traction was driven by articles about Buffer which we were triggering on an almost daily basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We essentially started to lose our most valuable asset in pitching Buffer</strong>. To add to the struggles, we were almost one month into our allowed three months in San Francisco on the visa waiver program, and we were also quickly running out of money because we didn&#8217;t realise how expensive the Bay Area is. With only two months left before we would have to move on from San Francisco, we were eager to raise the funding we had decided would be so valuable for building the startup further.</p>\n\n<p>However, one of the things we learned while figuring out how fundraising works is that <strong>two months is a very fast amount of time to close a seed round, even for the most experienced founders</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>A tough Saturday morning conversation</h3>\n\n<p>One Saturday morning around three weeks after we started our attempt to raise a seed round for Buffer, at the apartment where we were sharing a single room (alternating between one sleeping on a bed and the other on the floor on an airbed), <strong>Leo and I talked about what we were going to do to try and turn things around</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We had been trying for three weeks, and we had learned a lot about how to raise funding, but we now knew that a joint effort from both of us in order to try to quickly close a seed round was not going to be successful. <strong>We needed our traction to continue, since the fundraising was going to be a longer task</strong>. We had very little cash left, in fact I was actually borrowing money from Leo, who was well into his savings.</p>\n\n<p>So we needed a new strategy. Since I was the coder, we decided that <strong>I would be the one to work towards keeping our traction going</strong>, which I would do by building the product but also by doing all the marketing tasks which I was much less experienced with. <strong>Leo, on the other hand, would focus entirely on fundraising</strong> and learning more, and trying to figure it out. I would be pulled into meetings only when we reached a point where we were discussing terms.</p>\n\n<p>We knew it was going to be extremely difficult, with many highs and lows for both of us, which we would need to shield each other from and remain positive and optimistic. I think <strong>we both believed we could pull it off, but we knew there was a good chance that we might end up back home on a plane to the UK</strong> without closing the funding we sought.</p>\n\n<h3>An amazing high: Being accepted into AngelPad</h3>\n\n<p>The next few hours taught us how crazy life as a startup founder can be. We were both truly at a very low point, and <strong>we often look back with fond memories of that moment since it was a great example of the struggles founders have to go through</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Around 2 weeks into our attempt to raise funding, <strong>we had noticed that <a href=\"http://angelpad.org\">AngelPad</a> had a class coming up</strong>, and that even though the deadline had passed, they were accepting late applications. Since we were struggling, we applied. We didn&#8217;t take too long over it, though, and <strong>we quickly moved back to focusing on our fundraising efforts</strong>. We had a number of emails back and forth with Thomas, Gokul and others in the AngelPad team, and even had a Skype interview with Thomas. Still, we weren&#8217;t too confident we would get in.</p>\n\n<p>After our memorable Saturday morning discussion, Leo got a call from Thomas. <strong>We had got into AngelPad and would receive $120,000 in funding for Buffer</strong>. We&#8217;d go through the 10 week program with 14 other startups and have a demo day at the end, and we would be taught about how to raise funding. It was simply one of the most incredible moments of my life and I remember a real feeling of elation, compounded by the fact we had just had to make a very difficult decision a few hours prior, which no longer mattered.</p>\n\n<p>AngelPad proved to be a significant part of the Buffer journey, and enabled us to get some amazing advisors and investors on board when we did our fundraising after demo day. Although it was not easy, after the struggles and learning we had gone through <strong>we were fortunate to be able to raise a <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-17-awesome-investors-in-our-400000-seed-round-and-how-we-met-them\">$400,000 seed round</a> for Buffer</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I have realised that <strong>when I have low points, they are the times where the most growth and learning occurs</strong>. I would therefore not change a thing about those tough weeks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you had some truly low points during your startup journey so far? Have you found that these moments have taught you some valuable lessons? I&#8217;d love to hear from you in the comments.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/texaseagle/3335064831/\">TexasEagle</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/oPm0PJOpbUI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/oPm0PJOpbUI/39039594383", :published_at => Fri, 28 Dec 2012 14:42:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/39039594383", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

And it gets vaguer all the time. In this environment, the power of the specific, measurable and useful promise made and kept is difficult to overstate.&#8221; - <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/09/from-general-to-specific-or-vice-versa.html\">Seth Godin</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to be vague, broad, and to never commit to a particular direction. It&#8217;s frightening to be specific.</p>\n\n<p>One of the key things I&#8217;ve learned in the last two years of doing startups is that <strong>to make real progress, it&#8217;s important to be specific</strong>. I think this applies beyond email, but with a specific example I think it&#8217;s easier to understand.</p>\n\n<h3>Why it&#8217;s hard to be specific in emails</h3>\n\n<p>I was recently looking back at some of the emails I was sending out when I was just beginning my journey with startups. It was quite frankly embarrassing. In almost every case the emails were far too long and had no clear call to action. Still, <strong>emails are consistently somewhere that I see new founders struggling the most</strong>. They rarely get a reply and they often wonder why.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve realised, is that it&#8217;s actually very difficult to be specific. If we take the example of trying to get a meeting with a well-known investor, then it&#8217;s easy to think that we should let them choose the time. So you say something like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is your schedule looking next week?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems sensible. They&#8217;re probably much more busy, so if you suggest a time to meet it&#8217;s likely that it won&#8217;t work for them.</p>\n\n<h3>How vagueness fails to clinch that important meeting</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;A large array of options may discourage consumers because it forces an increase in the effort that goes into making a decision. So consumers decide not to decide, and don’t buy the product.&#8221; - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000TDGGVU/ref=r_soa_w_d\">Barry Schwartz in The Paradox of Choice</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What generally happens when the investor receives the email is that they have a number of options for &#8220;next week&#8221;. <strong>Rather than spending the effort to make that decision, they instead &#8220;decide not to decide&#8221; and you get no reply</strong> to your email. It happened to me countless times.</p>\n\n<h3>How I learned to be specific in emails</h3>\n\n<p>I was quite lucky - I was forced to improve the emails I was sending, because we were fundraising and <strong>email is still by far one of the most useful tools when raising investment</strong>. I learned by making the mistake over and over, and then deciding that a new approach was required.</p>\n\n<p>I asked advice from many people and discussed our approach with my co-founder Leo. I read lots of articles with great insights such as the following from <a href=\"http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/11/how-to-reply-to-angel-investor-intro.html\">Elad Gil</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Add specific times. This reduces the friction to scheduling as if you leave it open ended it (a) does not convey urgency and sets up the timeframe within which you will meet and (b) makes the investor work harder to figure things out. Don&#8217;t put the burden on them to suggest a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>How to write emails which get more replies</h3>\n\n<p>After many failed attempts to get meetings, I adjusted my approach. Instead of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is your schedule looking next week?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I started to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would 10am on Thursday at <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/south-beach-cafe-san-francisco\">South Beach Cafe</a> work for you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above is from a real email that I sent during the time we were raising our seed round.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing, is that by simply making that choice for them, <strong>it doesn&#8217;t mean it will always work for them but it means it is much easier for them to reply with a slight adjustment</strong>. We&#8217;d often get a reply such as:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thursday is tough, but Friday could work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I could do 10a but it would have to be in Hayes Valley as I have a 9a and an 11a there. Would La Boulange in Hayes work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From here, we were often able to confirm a meeting within one or two emails. This technique was crucial for us in securing investors for our <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-17-awesome-investors-in-our-400000-seed-round-and-how-we-met-them\">seed round</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you tried being more specific in your emails?

FeedEntry.create(:id => 486, :name => "Thinking about your goal with a startup", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3316/3480602438_74c03c0b50.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>I often reflect upon the differences between my previous startup and <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>, and think about what changes to my mindset affected the better outcome this time compared with my previous attempts.</p>\n\n<p>One of the mindset adjustments which I think has had a large impact on my success is to think about what my goal as an entrepreneur is. The key thing has been to <strong>focus on a goal of succeeding overall with creating a startup, rather than to focus on being successful with a particular idea.</strong> It&#8217;s an interesting tweak to your thinking, but one which I&#8217;ve found very powerful.</p>\n\n<h3>A goal to succeed with an idea</h3>\n\n<p>With my previous startup, <strong>one of the mistakes I made was to make my sole aim to succeed with the particular idea that I started with</strong>. Despite that fact that I still made adjustments to the idea and it changed a little, I had a mindset that I wanted to make the idea work. I struggled, with little traction and almost zero retention.</p>\n\n<p>When the goal is to succeed with the idea you have, you don&#8217;t give yourself much room to course-correct. The fact is, that <strong>almost all startups change considerably over their lifetime, so to stay fixated on that original idea can be detrimental</strong> to the success of the startup.</p>\n\n<h3>A goal to create a successful startup</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t succeed with your current startup, it&#8217;s not your fault. If you&#8217;re not successful in your career, it is your fault.&#8221; - <a href=\"http://chrisyeh.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/if-you-dont-succeed-with-your-startup.html\">Chris Yeh</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The better approach I&#8217;ve found is to <strong>focus solely on being successful with your startup, without the idea being involved in that equation</strong>. That way, you allow for the required change in order to arrive at an eventual success, rather than limiting your ability to adjust and move towards success.</p>\n\n<p>I truly believe that if you have not found something that works, something that people are using and find valuable, then you should be doing nothing but trying to reach that goal. In essence, <strong>if you are pre-product/market fit, then your only goal should be to reach product/market fit</strong>. What I want to suggest is that the goal of any startup founder should be to reach product/market fit with an idea, not necessarily the idea they started with.</p>\n\n<p>This ties in very well with the lean startup notion of <a href=\"http://lean.st/principles/validated-learning\">validated learning</a> being the measure of progress. A lot of the formalities can be forgotten in the early days of a startup. <strong>No need to incorporate, no need for an office. Just try to learn about your customers and figure out if your assumptions about your idea and market are correct. If not, make changes.</strong> If you need to make a big change and arrive at a whole different idea, then do it.</p>\n\n<h3>It&#8217;s a change in mindset</h3>\n\n<p>It may seem quite obvious to read, but I&#8217;ve found personally that this is very difficult in practice. I think a key reason Buffer was more successful than my previous endeavours was that <strong>I had reached a point with enough previous failure that I wanted so bad to succeed with something, with anything</strong>. That meant I didn&#8217;t mind if it was this idea or another I discovered. That slight shift in mindset makes you much more eager for feedback and learning, and makes you genuinely open to changing the idea based on that feedback. This means you listen and people can tell that you are truly appreciative of their time.</p>\n\n<p>Your goal should not be to succeed with a particular idea. Your goal should be to create a successful startup.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you previously found yourself limited by a goal focused on an idea, rather than being open to change? I&#8217;d love your thoughts on this topic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/spyndle/3480602438/\">Kreg Steppe</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/LDG3FSmDnr4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/LDG3FSmDnr4/38069169926", :published_at => Sun, 16 Dec 2012 16:30:26 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/38069169926", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

In the last few months, <strong>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about culture</strong> and asking many other founders about different aspects such as having an office, having company values and different forms of communication like team meetings and 1:1 meetings.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I realised recently when talking with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/__tosh\">Thomas Schranz</a>, the founder of the very cool <a href=\"https://www.blossom.io/\">Blossom</a>, was that we&#8217;ve actually got quite a few cool things in place that define the Buffer culture. <strong>It occurred to me that the different aspects of the culture were introduced at various times along the 2 year journey so far</strong>, and it forms the evolution of culture at Buffer.</p>\n\n<p>Since working on the culture has happened gradually, <strong>I wanted to document the things we&#8217;ve done for culture at the earliest stage of the startup</strong>, since as we go forward it might be more difficult to recall.</p>\n\n<h3>Culture as an evolutionary process</h3>\n\n<p>It seems rather obvious in hindsight, but <strong>only after growing a team over 2 years have I realised just how gradual and progressive building a startup culture is</strong>. When I started Buffer, I was a solo founder with no team for 3 months. Clearly, at that stage, there was no &#8220;culture&#8221;. Then Leo came on board and whilst we certainly talked about our approaches and put some things in place to help us be aligned, we still didn&#8217;t think in terms of a culture we we building.</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forwarding to now, where we are 7 people, <strong>I find myself thinking about culture a lot and making changes from time to time</strong>. Examples of topics that are in my mind are team communication, our approach to customer support, our release cycle time and how transparent we are.</p>\n\n<p>My belief now as a result of looking back at this process is that <strong>you can&#8217;t think too much about culture when you&#8217;re one or two founders, but you naturally need to think about it a lot more once you have a sizeable team</strong>. It&#8217;s certainly an evolutionary process, not something you just put in place once and never change.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how the Buffer culture has evolved, including some of the specific things we do which shape the culture we have:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/LVCs/culture-timeline.png\" width=\"497px\" height=\"267px\"/></p>\n\n<h3>Culture is deeply influenced by the founding team</h3>\n\n<p>Although company culture is something that is worked on over time and can be adapted a lot, it is heavily affected by the personalities of the founding team. <strong>There&#8217;s no right or wrong with culture, it is simply a combination of natural personality of the founding team in addition to proactive work to push the culture in a desired direction</strong> and to maintain certain values.</p>\n\n<p>A good recent example of this I&#8217;ve seen is Ev Williams describing his formula for startup success. One of his points is the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you don&#8217;t sleep, eat crap, don&#8217;t exercise, and are living off adrenaline for too long, your performance suffers. Your decisions suffer. Your company suffers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would agree that for me, this kind of culture is something I choose not to have with Buffer. That said, I see other startups which are very successful and yet they encourage employees to be at work until 11pm and do all night hackathons a lot. In essence, I think <strong>it&#8217;s up to you to choose the values and build a culture around them</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Since the early days, Leo and I have had a strong focus on self-improvement, always discussing what we&#8217;re currently working on and changing our routines. <strong>This has influenced the culture we&#8217;ve created, and it&#8217;s one with an emphasis on <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/22893893905/work-harder-on-yourself-than-you-do-on-your-startup\">working on yourself as much as the startup</a></strong>, with a lot of positive encouragement from everyone in the team.</p>\n\n<h3>It&#8217;s a choice to be proactive about your culture</h3>\n\n<p>The other thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that <strong>it is a choice for the founder as to whether you choose to &#8216;create&#8217; a specific culture</strong>. I agree with Jason Cohen that <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/2012/11/creating-a-company-culture-that-thrills-customers-at-wp-engine/\">with culture, one thing is certain</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every company has a culture. The only question is whether or not you decide what it is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is something I&#8217;ve found very interesting to ponder. I&#8217;ve met founders where I feel like they have let the culture develop by itself, and it still seems to work. At the same time, I think <strong>to build a culture that can inspire people to want to work for you, you will want to take the time to make specific changes to shape it</strong>. At Buffer, culture is definitely something we&#8217;re starting to be more deliberate about.</p>\n\n<p>On the extreme end of the &#8220;proactive&#8221; approach to culture, <strong>you can take an approach where you hire and fire people very specifically based on their fit with the culture</strong>. We are taking a path where we want to focus a lot on culture, so we&#8217;ve recently started to think hard about whether the next set of people who come on board are a great fit for the culture we&#8217;re creating. We&#8217;re definitely inspired by <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/allison-fass/tony-hsieh-zappos-i-fire-non-culture-fits-fast.html\">Tony Hsieh&#8217;s approach</a> and commitment to great culture:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even if someone&#8217;s great at their job, even if they&#8217;re a superstar at their job, if they&#8217;re bad for our culture we&#8217;ll fire them for that reason alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>How much do you focus on culture at your startup? Is it something you try to grab a hold of and throw in the direction you want the company culture to go, or do you let it develop naturally? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/yakshaving/3795071232/\">quami77</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/pJdlW-putmk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/pJdlW-putmk/37639846554", :published_at => Mon, 10 Dec 2012 15:28:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/37639846554", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

I attended events, spoke at events and even created my own meetup for startups. These were not particularly big events, but nevertheless <strong>I somehow found myself in a position of being able to help people, and a position where people would come to me to brainstorm and get advice</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I remember the point just before I started Buffer, where these events and opportunities came up more and more, despite the fact that my startup was not exploding with any kind of success. I had neither generated any revenue, nor raised any funding, and we didn&#8217;t have great traction either. <strong>I remember often feeling like a fraud, standing up there and telling others what to do when I had no success myself</strong>. I often questioned whether I should be up there. It also was one of the things that gave me the burning desire to figure out how to make something work.</p>\n\n<h3>Why we often feel like a fraud</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most interesting things I&#8217;ve found with this feeling is that it seems like <strong>it doesn&#8217;t ever stop</strong>. I now have the opportunity to speak at even bigger events, to help people quite far along with their startups, and also to help people just getting started who want my advice for things I really don&#8217;t know that much about.</p>\n\n<p>I recently attended <a href=\"http://leanstartupmachine.com/\">Lean Startup Machine</a> in <a href=\"http://leanstartupmachine.com/events/san-francisco-november-30-december-2/\">San Francisco</a> to mentor the teams and help them to validate their ideas. <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/ericries\">Eric Ries</a> did a Q&amp;A at the event, and one of the things he said was very interesting</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We are in the business as entrepreneurs to look at statistically insignificant sample sizes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This got me thinking more about why it is that we sometimes feel like a fraud, especially even as we make progress. It seems that <strong>as startup founders, we never have significant data</strong>. We can&#8217;t know for sure whether we were wholly responsible for all of our success, or whether other factors influenced things and we found ourselves being fortunate. That, for me, is the reason it&#8217;s easy to feel like a fraud.</p>\n\n<h3>Why we can help a lot even without &#8216;success&#8217;</h3>\n\n<p>Another thing I&#8217;ve found, is that <strong>we can usually help people much sooner than we realise</strong>. Over time I&#8217;ve managed to become quite comfortable <a href=\"http://joel.is/startup-help\">helping others regularly</a>, and the more I&#8217;ve done it the more I&#8217;ve realised that I can usually help a lot, and even if I can&#8217;t it&#8217;s always a fun conversation.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that there are quite a few founders where the thought to help others has crossed their mind, and the desire to do it exists, but they often dismiss it and decide that they haven&#8217;t learned enough yet, or people wouldn&#8217;t want their help.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/LIRb/helping-others.png\" width=\"497px\" height=\"266px\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://joel.is/post/28198804700/why-im-helping-startup-founders\">Helping others has been so powerful for me</a> for lots of different reasons, so I think <strong>it&#8217;s great to try and get past this myth that you can only help people once you have had a huge exit</strong>. In fact, I think a lot of the times it&#8217;s the people at the earliest stages that can help the most, because the gap is smaller and so the person you&#8217;re helping can really relate to the position you&#8217;re in.</p>\n\n<p>Just as these <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html\">&#8216;lizard brain&#8217;</a> thoughts about how entitled you are to help others can affect whether you will do so, if you take the plunge and start helping others I think you will often find that you feel like you don&#8217;t deserve to be giving the advice.</p>\n\n<h3>Could it be that it&#8217;s optimal to feel like a fraud?</h3>\n\n<p>What I have started to realise, is that perhaps this is exactly how we should feel if we&#8217;re making progress. It may seem counterintuitive, but <strong>I am starting to believe that if you feel like a fraud and feel uncomfortable, it&#8217;s probably a great thing</strong>. Just as the adage that &#8220;the magic happens outside your comfort zone&#8221; I think perhaps if you&#8217;re feeling like a fraud, you&#8217;re doing things right.</p>\n\n<p>I think the important thing is to remember that none of us have significant sample sizes or complete information about what we should do, or whether we deserve what success we have. Therefore it&#8217;s completely natural to feel like we&#8217;re not entitled, to feel like a fraud from time to time. I think <strong>the best thing to do is to remind ourselves that it&#8217;s our job to work with incomplete information, and to <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/4132813715/acting-with-incomplete-information-in-a-startup\">&#8220;do&#8221; where others stay paralysed</a> by lack of a clear path</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you ever felt like a fraud whilst working on your startup? I&#8217;d love to hear your experiences of battling with this feeling.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/faby74/2523026894/\">Fabiana Zonca</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/Uqcf449w-Kc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/Uqcf449w-Kc/37111202497", :published_at => Mon, 03 Dec 2012 14:00:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/37111202497", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)

Get ready to break it.", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8021/7325618288_b957a0475c.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.&#8221; - Aristotle</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been obsessed with thinking about, adjusting and building upon my habits for a long time now, and <strong>working on good habits is probably one of the things that&#8217;s helped me the most to make progress with my startup</strong>. In addition, it seems like habits are now becoming popular again. This is a great thing, and books like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/1400069289\">The Power of Habit</a> are helping lots of people.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve discovered that perhaps <strong>one of the things which is rarely discussed with habits is failing with them</strong>. How do you keep going with building habits when you fail one day, or you have some kind of momentary setback? I thought it might be useful for me to share my thoughts on habits, and particularly the aspect of failing with habits.</p>\n\n<h3>Building an awesome habit</h3>\n\n<p>There are the steps I&#8217;ve found which work best for creating an amazing habit:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Start so small you &#8220;can&#8217;t fail&#8221; (more on the reality of that later)</li>\n<li>Work on the small habit for as long as it becomes a ritual (something you&#8217;re pulled towards rather than which requires willpower)</li>\n<li>Make a very small addition to the habit, ideally anchored to an existing ritual</li>\n</ol><p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/L6v2/creating-habits.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<h3>How I built my most rewarding habit</h3>\n\n<p>The habit I&#8217;m happiest with is my morning routine. <strong>It gives me a fantastic start to the day and lots of energy.</strong> To build it, I took the approach above of starting small and building on top.</p>\n\n<p>I started my habit two years ago when I was based in Birmingham in the UK. The first thing I started with, was to go to the gym 2-3 times per week. That&#8217;s all my routine was for a long time. <strong>Once I had that habit ingrained, I expanded on it</strong> so that I would go swimming the other two days of the week, essentially meaning that I went to the gym every day at the same time. I&#8217;d go around 7:30, which meant I awoke at around 7am.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I gradually woke up earlier, first waking up at 6:45 for several weeks, and then 6:30. At the same time, I put in place my <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/5303723252/creating-a-sleep-ritual\">evening ritual of going for a walk</a>, which helped me wind down and get to sleep early enough to then awake early. Eventually, I achieved the ability to wake up at 6am and do 1 hour of productive work before the gym. <strong>This precious early morning time for work when I was the freshest was one of the things that helped me get <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a> off the ground</strong> in the early days.</p>\n\n<p>The next thing I made a real habit was to have breakfast after I returned from the gym. <strong>I then worked on making this full routine a habit for a number of months</strong>, and I had times when I <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/27260290057/thoughts-on-travelling-with-your-startup\">moved to a different country</a> and had to work hard to get back to the routine after the initial disruption of settling in. It was whilst in Hong Kong that I achieved being very disciplined with this routine and <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/24064139389/the-exercise-habit\">wrote about it</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>My morning routine</h4>\n\n<p>Today, I&#8217;ve built on top of this habit even further. Here&#8217;s what my morning routine looks like now:</p>\n\n<ul><li>I awake at 5:05am.</li>\n<li>At 5:10, I meditate for 6 minutes.</li>\n<li>I spend until 5:30 having a first breakfast: a bagel and a protein shake.</li>\n<li>I do 90 minutes of productive work on a most important task from 5:30 until 7am.</li>\n<li>At 7am, I go to the gym. I do a weights session every morning (different muscle group each day).</li>\n<li>I arrive home from the gym at 8:30am and have a second breakfast: chicken, 2 eggs and cottage cheese.</li>\n<li>At 9am we have the Buffer team standup video Skype call.</li>\n</ul><p>It may seem extremely regimented, and I guess perhaps it is. However, <strong>the important thing is the approach. You can start with one simple thing and then work on it over time.</strong> I&#8217;m now working to build around this current habit even more.</p>\n\n<h3>Failing whilst building your awesome habit</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most popular and simultaneously most controversial articles I&#8217;ve ever written is probably <a href=\"http://joel.is/post/24064139389/the-exercise-habit\">The Exercise Habit</a>. It&#8217;s one which has been mentioned to me many times by people I&#8217;ve met to <a href=\"http://joel.is/startup-help\">help with their startup challenges</a>. I&#8217;ve been humbled to find out that a number of people have been inspired by the article to start a habit of daily exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Whilst in Tel Aviv, I met <a href=\"http://twitter.com/eytanlevit\">Eytan Levit</a>, a great startup founder who has since become a good friend. He told me he had read my article and was immediately driven to start a habit of daily exercise. I sat down and had coffee with him and he told me about his experience, it was fascinating. He told me that <strong>he did daily exercise for 4 days in a row, and he felt fantastic</strong>. He said he felt like he had more energy than ever before, and was ready to conquer the world. Then, on the 5th day Eytan struggled to get to the gym for whatever reason, and essentially the chain was broken. The most revelatory thing he said to me was that the reason he didn&#8217;t start the habit again was not that he didn&#8217;t enjoy the exercise or benefit greatly from doing it. <strong>The reason he failed to create the exercise habit was the feeling of disappointment of not getting to the gym on that 5th day</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Get ready and expect to break your habit</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&#8220;I deal with procrastination by scheduling for it. I allow it. I expect it.&#8221; - <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/53633293#t=575\">Tim Ferriss</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I&#8217;ve realised, is that <strong>one of the key parts of building habits might be to know that you will not flawlessly create your habits</strong>. You are going to break your habit at some point, you are going to fail that next day or next gym session sooner or later. <strong>The important thing is to avoid a feeling of guilt and disappointment, because that is what will probably stop you</strong> from getting up the next day and continuing with the routine.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar way to how Tim Ferriss deals with procrastination, I believe <strong>we should not try so hard to avoid breaking our habits</strong>. We should instead be calm and expect to break them sometime, let it happen, then regroup and get ready to continue with the habit. Perhaps we took too much on, and we cut back a little or try to add one less thing to our habit. Or maybe we just had a bad day. That&#8217;s fine, and <strong>a single failure shouldn&#8217;t stop our long-term success with building amazing habits</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a habit you were building and are not anymore? Why is that? Which habit are you happiest with? I&#8217;d love to hear your experiences on creating habits.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/darinaniz/7325618288/\">darinaniz</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/B_9ydF4a4u8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/B_9ydF4a4u8/36591651818", :published_at => Mon, 26 Nov 2012 14:30:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/36591651818", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
FeedEntry.create(:id => 490, :name => "The maker/manager transition phase", :summary => "<p><img src=\"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/51/168076182_000347f78d.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://paulgraham.com\">Paul Graham</a> has a fantastic article on the topic of <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">scheduling work as a maker and as a manager</a>, which I&#8217;ve drawn insights from and I know many others have too. Here&#8217;s a key part of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they&#8217;re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The great piece is focused around two sets of distinct people in a startup: makers (typically coders) and managers (those with lots of meetings). The interesting thing I&#8217;ve found is that <strong>as a startup founder you often have to transition from a maker to a manager, and there will also be a period of time when you need to be both at once</strong>. I wanted to share my experience of dealing with the transition from maker to manager.</p>\n\n<h3>The maker focus</h3>\n\n<p>In the early days, being comfortable in a &#8220;maker&#8221; schedule, for example cranking out lots of code or content fast, is essential. Of course, there is an element of &#8220;manager&#8221; activities whether it&#8217;s getting press or doing customer development, but <strong>a large portion of the work around building a great product and gaining traction is &#8220;maker&#8221; work by nature</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The key question to ask, is, is 1 hour of my time better spent &#8220;making&#8221; or &#8220;managing&#8221;? In the first few months, you&#8217;re likely just a couple of guys, and you can&#8217;t move faster by delegating than by just getting stuck in and doing it yourself. For almost the first year of <a href=\"http://bufferapp.com\">Buffer</a>, I&#8217;d say Leo and I were mostly in &#8220;maker&#8221; schedules, where we would chat briefly for a small portion of the day, then just get on with our tasks.</p>\n\n<p>I think as founders we all want to be visionary and do more than just write code, but to get to that stage we have to learn to thrive in the maker schedule and get the product off the ground.</p>\n\n<h3>The maker/manager split</h3>\n\n<p>I learned the hard way that you don&#8217;t just switch completely from being a maker to a manager. Additionally, the transition phase between the two is probably one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve experienced as a startup founder. There&#8217;s no way around it, <strong>you have to juggle being a maker and a manager for at least a few months, so you better figure out how to do that</strong>. Here&#8217;s how it worked for me:</p>\n\n<p>The transition happened after the team had grown to 5 people. I suddenly realised that if I didn&#8217;t have a clear idea about what it is best for others to work on, then they would be much less effective. We realised having lists for people was efficient. I made the mistake of dropping coding completely, as I felt like it was no longer an important thing for me to do. I then took some time to think, and realised I needed to spend a number of months being both a maker and a manager. It&#8217;s a difficult phase.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://joelg.cc/KzDA/maker-manager-transition.png\" alt=\"\"/></p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, we realised how powerful mobile will be for Buffer, but the team was small and we had no spare resources for Android development. So I decided that I would learn Android from scratch, and at least get the app off the ground and learn what we needed from someone who would eventually lead our Android development. So, <strong>for 2-3 months, I spent 50% of my time coding Java, and 50% doing manager tasks</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For some weeks, I spent every morning coding, and every afternoon doing manager activities. This worked well, but often my maker time would overflow as I didn&#8217;t feel I&#8217;d achieved enough. I was lucky enough to sit down and chat with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eden\">Eden Shochat</a> about this, and he instantly recommended instead of half days, I do full days. I found this much better, and I also noticed that <a href=\"http://bjk5.com/post/35488799286/a-maker-managers-schedule\">Ben Kamens does the same</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>The manager focus</h3>\n\n<p>During the time I spent in the maker/manager split, I came across <strong>one of the most powerful concepts I&#8217;ve discovered as a first-time CEO: to &#8220;fire thyself&#8221;</strong>. It came from an awesome <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/28/first-fire-thyself/\">article by Joe Kraus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you&#8217;re a founding CEO, I believe that you are doing your company a disservice if you don&#8217;t fire yourself from your skill position. Your goal, crazy as it sounds, is to free up 50% of your time by constantly firing yourself from whatever skill position you&#8217;re playing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Over the next month, I searched for a great engineer to take over Android development, and I was lucky to find <a href=\"http://twitter.com/sunils34\">Sunil</a>. I gradually let Sunil take over and dropped my maker/manager split to 25% Android development, and eventually dropped it completely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One of the hardest things as a developer transitioning into a manager role has been to get a feeling of progress without writing code</strong>. Progress is usually clear with code, and harder with manager activities. However, when you get towards 10 people in your team, coming back to the question from earlier is interesting: is 1 hour of my time better spent on &#8220;making&#8221; or &#8220;managing&#8221;? <strong>As a founder you&#8217;re in the best position to guide people and help them be super productive. That becomes your role.</strong> For me, I&#8217;m spending a lot of time finding great people to join Buffer, and also making adjustments all the time within the team.</p>\n\n<p>As for coding, I still do a little. I help with development of our browser extensions, since that is the part of our codebase which has the least engineering resources, and is still very important for Buffer. <strong>Of course, I&#8217;m in the midst of firing myself from that, too.</strong> If you&#8217;re a JavaScript engineer in the bay area, I&#8217;d love to <a href=\"http://buff.ly/OJImbd\" target=\"_blank\">hear from you</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have you found yourself torn between being a maker and a manager? Are you still coding when you should be building a company and awesome culture? I&#8217;d love to hear your experiences on this topic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pgoyette/168076182/\">Paul Goyette</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/joelis/~4/JsoCbWC17g4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", :url => "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/joelis/~3/JsoCbWC17g4/36051780992", :published_at => Mon, 19 Nov 2012 06:30:00 UTC +00:00, :guid => "http://joel.is/post/36051780992", :feed_title => "Joel Gascoigne", :feed_id => 14)
