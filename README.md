leanatics
=========

My own little personal project. I like to keep current with the blog posts from the lean startup thought leaders I look up to. I know Google Reader and other feed readers work great for this, but I wanted to point more light on Lean Startup and those leading the charge. I also wanted some additional functionality like the ability to easily send a blog post to Buffer or schedule a call via Clarity.fm.

If you have ideas for improving it, or if I left out somone important - shoot me a message on twitter - [@spinuplabs](http://twitter.com/#!/spinuplabs).

Leanatics is a side project of Brent Weber @ [SpinUp Labs](http://spinuplabs.com)
