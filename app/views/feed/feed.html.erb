      This project is my own little itch-scratching.  I like to keep current with the blog posts from the lean startup thought leaders I look up to.  I know Google Reader and other feed readers work great for this, but I wanted to point more light on <%= link_to 'Lean Startup','http://theleanstartup.com/', :target => '_blank'  %> and those leading the charge.  I also wanted some additional functionality like the ability to easily send a blog post to <%= link_to 'Buffer','http://bufferapp.com', :target => '_blank' %> or schedule a call via <%= link_to 'Clarity.fm','http://clarity.fm', :target => '_blank' %>.
